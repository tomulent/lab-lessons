<strong>Expectations:</strong>
You are expected to be in class each week, prepared and on time. If you cannot make it to class for whatever reason, you will be responsible for obtaining the information we covered in class from one of your classmates, or meeting me by appointment for further clarification. If you must miss class (sick, etc.) you must email the lab leader and lab facilitator at least an hour before lab. Failure to notify the lab leader and facilitator by email will result in being marked absent. Each unexcused absences after two result in a 10% penalty to your overall grade in the lab

All resources and assignments will be posted on <a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org">labs.everettprogram.org</a>. Read everything. If a resource is optional, it will be labeled as such in its title. You will be responsible for this information on the midterm and for use on your final project, although it may not be reiterated in class.

Due dates for all assignments is be noted on the syllabus. An email will be sent out on Fridays detailing your homework for each week. Please pay attention to the method by which to submit these assignments, as they will vary. You may submit up to one week late and receive up to 50%. If you did your work on time but got a bad grade, you have the option of resubmitting no later than one week after the due date, and changing your received grade up to 70%.

Collaboration and mutual support are critical to success in video production so expect to be working with others and to support one another. Video production is rarely a one person job and you will benefit more from the experience depending on how much you put into it.

It is important to note that along with the weekly meeting time there will be mandatory participation on Saturday May 2nd. More information on that to come.
