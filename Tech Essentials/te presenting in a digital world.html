[toggle title="10-20-30 Rule"]
### 10-20-30 Rule
#### **What Does This Rule Stand for?**
The 10-20-30 rule is a simple yet effective way to enhance any presentation. It will help structure and organize your speech as well as simplify the layout and design of your PowerPoint presentation. You can easily avoid design mistakes by using this rule.

<b>**So what is the rule all about?**</b>

It’s simple: A presentation should have no more than 10 slides, should not take longer than 20 minutes and have a font of 30pt!

**10**: According to Guy Kawasaki** ten is the optimal amount of slides** for any successful business presentation. Presentations with more than ten slides will tire the audience and they won't pay attention as well. This does not mean that you should try to cram as much information as possible into these ten slides! Rather, focus on your key messages. As a guideline, Kawasaki lists ten key terms which can be taken as an orientation:
<ul>
	<li>Problem</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Your Solution</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Business model</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Underlying magic/ technology</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Marketing and sales</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Competition</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Team</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Projections and milestones</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Status and timeline</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Summary and call to action</li>
</ul>
According to your individual topic, these ten terms may be altered to fit your presentation!

**20**: Present your topic in a time frame of **twenty minutes**, even if there is more time at hand. Always keep in mind that technical difficulties can arise, people may be late, or other unexpected chaos can happen. This is why it is reasonable to only present for twenty minutes and use the remaining time for discussion or questions.

**30**: **Use a 30pt font**. This way you avoid overloading your slides with text and information. The audience has a hard time reading the small font and quickly loses interest. To get your audience’s attention use simplicity and clarity. If you feel 30pt is too small, at least use 20pt for your slides!

### Design Slides by...
<ul>
	<li>Using professional color schemes</li>
	<li>Possibly including the company, NGO, or business icon/ logo on slides</li>
	<li>Using appropriate images</li>
	<li>Utilizing attractive shapes and layout</li>
	<li>Making sure your slides are balanced</li>
	<li>Ensuring they are aesthetically pleasing
<ul>
	<li>Color coding/ labeling works well</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

### Non-Designed Slides...
<ul>
	<li>Have too much text</li>
	<li>Have text typed on top of illustrations</li>
	<li>Are boring and cookie-cutter</li>
	<li>Look the same throughout the presentation</li>
	<li>Lack originality and creativity</li>
	<li>Use too complex wording</li>
	<li>Are excessively busy, overly colorful, obnoxious, hard to read</li>
	<li>Have too complex and overly detailed maps, images, charts, etc.</li>
	<li>Do not convey messages directly</li>
	<li>Use imagery that is unrelated to the message</li>
</ul>

# Prezi - More Pizzazz in Presentations
[toggle title="Why Use Prezi?"]

Prezi has been around for a few years now and has really taken off. It's free to use, intuitive, and can be as simple or complex as you need it to be.

Why use Prezi? It really comes down to visual flair. There's a whole universe of "Slideware" out there like PowerPoint and some others that we'll be talking about in this lesson. We think Prezi is one of the most visually striking of them all. Microsoft PowerPoint allows you to do a few things like animated transitions (which get tacky really quick) as you go from one static slide to another, but Prezi is about making things more free form.

Using a well made Prezi will make your presentation (and more importantly your ideas!) stand out from the generic PowerPoint crowd. Using Prezi in a class presentation will increase the likelihood for an A. The previous statement is not legally binding.

## Prezi Tutorial
[toggle title="Getting Started"]

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/474eRk-xpSY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

The above video gives you a super quick overview of the basics of making a Prezi. You can read about the individual parts on their <a href="https://prezi.com/support/article/steps/get-started-with-prezi/">Getting Started Page</a>. If you read nothing else, read this.

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/E8Xfk8hcjhc" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

It's important to understand the difference between Edit Mode and Present Mode. You'll switch between them many times as you create a Prezi.

## Sharing Prezi
[toggle title="Why Share?"]

Prezi has some great sharing features built into it. Why share? It's a great way to give your ideas legs! The more people that have access to your ideas the better.

You may one day find yourself working for an NGO and being tasked with increasing your org's web presence. The best way to do this is to produce original content and share it. Presentations are a form of content just like images and videos. Content is the currency of the interwebs so it only makes sense that you would leverage the sharing features of Prezi.

Check out all of <a href="https://prezi.com/user/GIIP/" target="_blank">Everett's Prezis</a>!

[/toggle]

[toggle title="Download as a PDF"]

&nbsp;

Sometimes you are going somewhere with poor connectivity and can't rely on being able to get on the web to access a Prezi you've made. It's always good to have fallback plans when preparing a presentation so Prezi allows you to make a PDF copy of your presentation. It won't be quite as pretty but it's guarenteed to work no matter what computer you use.
## In Edit Mode Hit the Share Button
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4303" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/1000_en_download_as_pdf.png" alt="1000_en_download_as_pdf" width="1270" height="682" />
## Select "Download as PDF"

## Save It Once It's Done Compiling

# How Does It Compare?
See for yourself. Check out <a href="http://prezi.com/uwqrrs4fb1w-/?utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=copy">This Prezi on College Basics</a> one of the Everett Fellows made for the Summer camp.

Now compare it with the PDF version <a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/What-is-College.pdf">What is College</a>.pdf

You can see that the original is more theatrical with text animations and such. The PDF definitely gets the job done though.

[/toggle]

[toggle title="Simply Share"]

You can always simply share the link to the Prezi as well. Just hit the share button and copy the link they give you. You can do this for any public Prezi BTW.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4308" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Schare-a-prezi.png" alt="Schare a prezi" width="1005" height="659" />

[toggle title="Embed a Prezi"]

If you have a website (and you all will by the end of this lab!) you can embed a fully functioning Prezi in a webpage. You may have noticed we've done that throughout the Tech Essentials website.

It's easy to do. Just hit "Embed" when on a Prezi Page

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/What_is_College__by_Jessica_Crosby_on_Prezi.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6462" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/What_is_College__by_Jessica_Crosby_on_Prezi.png" alt="What_is_College__by_Jessica_Crosby_on_Prezi" width="1896" height="1116" /></a>

You will be presented with a window like this:

The Prezi will be embedded by copying the code onto your clip board, then pasted into the text editor of your website. We will go more into detail on this in next weeks lesson.

# PowerPoint
[toggle title="Why use it"]

We all are familiar with MS PowerPoint and what it does. When you want to give a presentation with a clear and brief slide show, PowerPoint is your friend. You can use simple titles and bullet points to create a quick and clear presentation, or, you can insert images, graphs and other multimedia into your slides to look more professional!
## Pros
<ul>
	<li>No internet? No problem!
<ul>
	<li>Access, edit and present your slides smoothly without worrying about internet connection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Simple or complex, your choice
<ul>
	<li>PPT offers templates that allows you to create quick and simple slides in a short time.</li>
	<li>If you want to level up and be a little more fancy, PPT also allows you to insert multimedia, animation, graphs etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Combine Excel for beautiful graphs
<ul>
	<li>When you insert graphs to your slides, PPT will open an Excel spread sheet so you can simply copy and paste existing data to create the graph.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Share in different forms
<ul>
	<li>If you want to share your PPT with others or post it online, PPT offers a number of different formats to satisfy your needs!</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Practice your presentation skills with PPT
<ul>
	<li>PPT is so cool that it allows you to time yourself while presenting your slides. The function tells you how long you spend on each slide, so if you're worried about the length of your presentation, PPT got your back!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
## Cons
<ul>
	<li>Distract your audience
<ul>
	<li>Does this happen to you: during lecture, whenever your professor shows a new ppt slide, you're too busy copying every bit of information down to listen to the lecture. If yes, you're not alone. Slide shows are a distraction if you don't integrate it with your presentation effectively. Use the tips in this lesson to avoid it!</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Animation is a bit tacky
<ul>
	<li>To be honest, the animation PPT has to offer is only cool in the eyes of a 7-year-old.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Online cooperation is not easy
<ul>
	<li>Let's face it, if you need to create a slide show with your team over the internet, PPT isn't the best choice. Unlike Prezi and Google Presentations, PPT works better when you're working on a personal presentation rather than a group presentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

[toggle title="Sharing PPT"]

PPT don't allow online cooperation, but it doesn't mean you can't share it with others. You can always save your slideshow and upload it onto cloud services such as google drive or dropbox, or you can send it directly via emails. When you save your slideshows, PPT gives you different options based on your need and purpose.

For example:
<ul>
	<li>PowerPoint presentation: If the receiver have PPT installed, s/he will be able to open, edit and save the slide show you share with her/him.</li>
	<li>PowerPoint Show: As soon as you open the file, your presentation will start in full-screen mode. There are not editing allowed.</li>
	<li>PDF: The PDF format is not necessarily for presentation purpose but more for record-keeping. For example, many of the professors upload their lecture slides on ecommons in PDF format.</li>
</ul>

# Google Presentations
[toggle title="Why Use Google Presentations"]

Google Presentations are a type of file you can create with Google Drive. Just as you've created Google Docs for word processing, and Google Sheets for spreadsheets, you can create presentations as well.

Google Presentation offers a more stripped down experience from PowerPoint. It has transitions and animations and such, but it's not as feature rich. Some people like having fewer options because it lets you focus on just the writing of clear content and the task of presenting it cleanly.
## Pro
<ul>
	<li>Free
<ul>
	<li>You don't need to pay Google to use their apps</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Simple
<ul>
	<li>You won't be distracted by 10,000 options and features</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Collaboration
<ul>
	<li>Have multiple people working on the same presentation in real time rather than emailing a PPT back and forth</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Embed videos
<ul>
	<li>Difficult in PPT</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
## Con
<ul>
	<li>Simple
<ul>
	<li>There's a limit to how complex and professional you can get these things</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Web Based
<ul>
	<li>No internet? No editing or presenting. You can download as a PDF though. You can export as a PPT file, but it will require a bit of work to get it looking right.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Go!Animate is a site that allows you to create your own animation with simple steps. No fancy tech-y knowledge required, just click around, and you can visualize the image in your head into a short animation!

Go!Animate is a great tool to spice things up, visualize your thoughts, create a scenario as a hook, help your audience engaging in the presentation, and so on. And more importantly, it's easy to learn, flexible to your needs, and with high quality!  It's also a great way to advertise a organization, create a campaign or start a cause. When you have limited resources such as software, camera, and funding, but want to integrate videos into your  presentation, Go!Animate is an alternative way to accomplish the goal.

# SlideShare
[toggle title="What Is SlideShare?"]

SlideShare is a web service for sharing your slideware. Slideware is any kind of presentation medium meant to be viewed one slide at a time, so things like PowerPoint, Google Presenation, Keynote, and to a lesser extent Prezi.

As we said earlier in the lesson, presentations are content, and content should be shared, both to spread knowledge and to build rep for your org. SlideShare offers a popular and easy to use platform on which to do that.

Many companies curate huge SlideShare libraries. We're big fans of HubSpot for all things social media. They're a marketing firm, but they produce an insane amount of conent that is applicable to nonprofit fundraising and communications.

SlideShare allows you to archive your presentations publicly online and share them easily. Look back to Lesson 5 in the Facebook section under "Setting Up and Using a Page" you'll see a presentation that was found on SlideShare and embedded in the webpage.

[toggle title="What Can I Upload?"]

You are allowed to upload the following file types
### Presentations
Adobe PDF (.pdf)
OpenOffice Presentation Document (.odp)
Microsoft PowerPoint (.ppt/.pps/.pptx/.ppsx/.pot/.potx)
### Documents
Adobe PDF (.pdf)
Microsoft Word (.doc/ .docx/ .rtf)
OpenOffice Documents (.odt)most .txt files
### Infographics
Adobe PDF (.PDF)

Notice that this says you can upload text documents and PDFs as well. You can use slideshare to host documents for people to download, but we're just going to talke about presenations.
## Google Presentations
Supposedly you should be able to add presentations directly from Google Drive, but I've not had any luck with that. You'd get better success by just downloading your Google Presenation as a PowerPoint and then uploading it to SlideShare.
