We learned a tremendous amount in the introductory web design lab. This tech section will extend that learning to give you a better understanding of how WordPress fits in the context of Nonprofits. You will also dive deeper into CSS and learn just a smidgen of PHP. By the end of the course, you will be able to create a functioning site for any small Non Profit or NGO and teach them how to use and maintain it.

**Week 1 – 4/2 - Digging into WordPress**

*A review of why we feel the content of this lab is important to you as non-engineer hackers. We’ll go through real world examples of the skills you’ll be learning and then creating a development environment on which you’ll be doing work for the quarter.*

**Week 2 - 4/9 - Developer Tools**

*Most, if not all, web browsers come with developer tools. Developer tools are a suite of helpful utilities that range from allowing you to inspect elements on a webpage and their associated CSS, to being able to see communications between the web server and browser. In this lab, we will be focusing on the tools that best aid us in customizing our WordPress websites.*

**Week 3 – 4/16 - Child Themes**

*Child themes are one of the most important tools in the WordPress Integration Specialist’s toolkit. They allow you to take a theme you like and tweak it to be a theme you love. They allow you to do this in a way that won’t break your site.*

**Week 4 – 4/23 - Messin’ With Templates**

*Going more technical, we uncover what makes WordPress tick. Templates are the instructions that the browser uses to construct a page using records from the database. That will make more sense when we finish the lesson.*

**Week 5 – 4/30 - Midterm**

*Putting together everything from the previous 4 weeks. The midterm is difficult but you’ll have plenty of support. You will create a detailed child theme using the _s theme framework.*

**Week 6 – 5/7 - Backups, Restoration, and Migration Part I**

*As a WordPress Integration Specialist, you must become proficient in commanding the bundle of files and data that make up a WordPress website. This lesson will walk you through the various methods of backing up, restoring, and migrating a website from one location to another. We will also teach you how to create a local development environment so that you can work on a website without an internet connection.*

**Week 7 – 5/14 - Backups, Restoration, and Migration Part II**

*There is a lot to cover*

**Week 8 – 5/21 - Site Maintenance and Benevolent IT**

*We move into a less technical phase of the class and discuss more how you can be an effective webmaster for your org. We will go over creating a maintenance routine, as well as best practices for effectively communicating and teaching key technical lessons to your NGO. We will also learn about proper documentation. Plus you will learn how a differential gear works!*

**Week 9 – 5/28 - Custom Post Types and Proper Taxonomy**

*WordPress is a powerful CMS because of the way it allows you to create and sort large quantities of data. We will learn about the various uses of custom post types as well as how to properly employ taxonomies (tags and categories) so that users of the site can easily find what they’re looking for and your NGO can spend less time managing the website.*

**Week 10 – 6/4 - The Final**

*The exact form of the final is to be determined but will most likely take the form of a mock website consultancy. You will create a website that satisfies the communicated needs of a fictional NGO.*
