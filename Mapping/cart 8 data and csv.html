# Organizing Your Data
Organizing your data is very important both when you collect it and when you display it. Sometimes both times are dependent upon each other. For example, some digital mapping tools may need you to organize your information in an excel sheet with labels or need your to convert your geo data.

This week, we will be taking a step back to look at ways of importing large amounts of data
**
Geocoding**</pre>
Geocoding is the act of converting addresses to latitude and longitudinal coordinates. Certain mapping tools require you to geocode geographic data before automatically mapping the locations for you. Because you might not want to gather the latitude and longitude coordinates for hundreds of addresses, you need to find a converter to speed up the process.  Sometimes you will have to include this information to your Excel sheet when uploading data for your map (depends on your mapping tool). Here are some resources:

CSV**
A comma-separated values (**CSV**) file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The use of the comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format.
