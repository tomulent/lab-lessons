## Homework Assignment
For this assignment you will be creating 3 separate images displaying the different ways you can use brushes.  I recommend installing brushes from [Brusheezy](http://brusheezy.com) (there much better and easier to work with for this purpose). Make a 3 different flyers for a made-up event to outreach for. You are just changing the background for each image, so you can reuse the same event info.  Please make sure you submit your images in a jpeg file (Save for Web &gt; JPEG)

1) The first image should show the brush being used as a background.

2) The second image should show the brush being used as a background and incorporating the gradient map tool.
