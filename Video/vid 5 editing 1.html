"**The Browser** is where you'll find all of your video clips and sequences. You can add video files to your project by importing the footage into the browser. In order to keep your footage organized, you can create folders called 'bins'. If your video project is a narrative film, you can add all the takes of a particular scene to one bin, or if it's a documentary, you can arrange your footage based on your shooting location and date. I recommend naming the files in your browser according to what they contain so you can easily navigate your project.

**The Viewer** is located on the top-half of the window layout in the center of the screen. This is where you'll view video clips from your browser, and choose which parts you'd like to include in your project. After you double click on a clip, check out the top or the Viewer window. It should read: Viewer: Name of Clip in Name of Project.

**The Canvas window**, to the right of the Viewer, is where you'll view sequences from the browser or timeline. A new tab will appear along the top of the window for each sequence you open. Similar to the Viewer window, you'll see a box on the right that represents the total time of your sequence, and a box on the right that represents the time at which you are currently viewing the sequence. In the middle, there are controls for adjusting the size of the image, adding playhead synchronization, and also more viewing options. Along the bottom are the same controls as in the Viewer window, except these will pertain to the editing sequence at hand rather than a video clip.

**The Timeline** is the main workspace for your FCP 7 project. It provides a visual representation for every editing command you carry out, whether it be making a cut, inserting a video clip, or adding new video tracks for text and mattes. The Timeline includes all of your audio and video tracks, depending on how much media you're using. If you want to layer, composite, or add effects to multiple clips, you'll be able to do so by manipulating each of the clips in the timeline on separate tracks. To the right of the timeline is the toolbox where you'll find you're editing controls. The most often used are the arrow, the blade, and the marker, which allow you to click, cut, and control keyframes, respectively." - <a href="http://desktopvideo.about.com/od/finalcutprotutorials/ss/Final-Cut-Pro-7-Tour.htm#step-heading">http://desktopvideo.about.com</a>
