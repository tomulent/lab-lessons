Go back to your proposal app from Project Two and make a copy of it. This is so you'll have a backup copy of your app at previous stages of development.

You'll be using your new knowledge of navigation methods to improve your proposal app.
### Parameters
On the homepage of your app, create a listview containing links to each section of your proposal (i.e. each page of your app).

Get rid of the stupid forward/backward links at the bottom of each page and simply replace them with a button linking back to the home page. Give the button a "home" icon usingÂ **data-icon="home"**.

Upload it to your server and send me a link. You may have noticed that I've just been putting my examples into a folder called "mobile-test" and giving them names like "project-1" and "project-3". You might want to do the same thing to keep everything tidy.

Here's what mine looks like. Check out the source code if you get stuck.
