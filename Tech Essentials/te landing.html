# Welcome to Technology Essentials Fall 2015!
The field of information technology is a constantly expanding: social media is ingrained into our everyday routines, new smartphone apps are available every day, old hardware is being refurbished, identities are being stolen and new personas are being created. This is intimidating to a lot of people, and for this reason a lot of practical, straightforward uses of information technology are avoided altogether. The objective of Technology Essentials is to erode this intimidation and anxiety and turn information technology into something that can be malleable, sustainable, easily understood, and enjoyable to use.
