**Project Management**

Explore tools and resources that help create efficient personal practices for project research and management. This lesson will cover how to set practical goals, efficiently manage tasks, how to conduct productive research on the web, and to put it simply how to “get things done.”
## Outcomes For This Lesson
Today we will look at a series of tools that will help design, manage, implement, monitor, and evaluate a project. These tools are important for your project and content because they help individuals and project directors run the internal portion of the project efficiently.

**Why this is important for your project/ Context**
The chances are that project managers will have to work with a team of people that are not always able to meet in person. You will need to have good clear and organized communication with your team to reach desired goals in a timely manner

## Setting Practical Goals
[toggle title="Personal Management"]
<ol>
	<li>Create timelines, deadlines, and schedules that are do-able
<ul>
	<li>We are all crazy busy, but who will be the time management queen or king? hmmm....</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Like a project, your goals must be do-able in the sense that they *should not* be overly estimated or sell short
<ul>
	<li>Can you *really* finish a five-page paper in 2 hours? Would it be better to start earlier and work steadily?</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>If you are working in a groups, group deadlines are important to stick to: talk to your group mates about weekly schedules and time conflicts to prevent unhappy group mates
<ul>
	<li>Planning is especially crucial in managing your time and others’ time: lack of planning = poor results</li>
	<li>**“Piss Poor Planning Promotes Piss Poor Performance”**</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Communicating with others and setting personal goals is key to project management
<ul>
	<li>Communicating with others intersects with accountability
<ul>
	<li>Be someone you would want to rely on or trust in a group situation!</li>
	<li>Don't be lame: call/text/email back; contribute; be proactive! You got this!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Do not save everything until the last minute—procrastination really does not do you or anyone else any good!</li>
</ol>

[toggle title="Doodle"]
<h3 class="p3">[Doodle](http://doodle.com)</h3>
Doodle is** the scheduling solution** that can free you from the tedious email threads that clutter up your inbox with eight different people conferring on their respective availability. Identify a few potential windows for the call or meeting you're trying to schedule, and ask everyone who needs to be there to identify all the times that could work for them (not just their preferred windows). Doodle makes it easy to spot the time slot that works for all of them, or as many as possible. Doodle is amazing for finding out the ideal time for meetings and group activities without the struggle of individually calculating everyone’s free times! It makes scheduling a breeze. The only problem: the Doodle will delete itself 2 weeks after you create it; so save the info! To use Doodle, you need to create an account (or connect through your Gmail or Facebook). Then, select “schedule an event” at the top right corner of the page. From there, name the Doodle, select dates, and add time proposals! After, simply type in the names of all the people you wish to take the poll!
An example of what a Doodle poll looks like!

## Conducting Project Research
[toggle title="Reliable Sources"]
<ul>
	<li>Check your sources before citing them!</li>
	<li>Find the source of an article rather than just the website you found it on: The Huffington Post may have a lot of information/ articles, but how is this information biased? Try and find where that information actually derived from!</li>
</ul>
**What's the difference between . . . ?**

**COM** - This domain is intended for commercial entities, that is companies. This domain has grown very large and there is concern about the administrative load and system performance if the current growth pattern is continued. Consideration is being taken to subdivide the COM domain and only allow future commercial registrations in the subdomains.

**EDU** - This domain was originally intended for all educational institutions. Many Universities, colleges, schools, educational service organizations, and educational consortia have registered here. More recently a decision has been taken to limit further registrations to 4 year colleges and universities. Schools and 2-year colleges will be registered
in the country domains.

**NET** - This domain is intended to hold only the computers of network providers, that is the NIC and NOC computers, the administrative computers, and the network node computers. The customers of the network provider would have domain names of their own (not in the NET TLD).

**ORG** - This domain is intended as the miscellaneous TLD for organizations that didn't fit anywhere else. Some non- government organizations may fit here.

**INT** - This domain is for organizations established by international treaties, or international databases.

*United States Only Generic Domains: *

**GOV** - This domain was originally intended for any kind of government office or agency. More recently a decision was taken to register only agencies of the US Federal government in this State and local agencies are registered in the country.

*Tip*: When typing in the google search bar I have found, from my 10 years of googling, that typing in phrase or key words of what I am searching for. This provided me with a wider search on what I am looking for and it allows me to see the words I searched for or similar to it! It even provides other search options I can do in the future.

Do you take notes on the computer and wish you had a better way of saving them? Have you ever lost all of your saved notes on your computer because there was no way to conveniently back them up? Fear no more! Evernote is a fantastic way to take digital notes, create reminders, and more! You simply go to the site, download the app, install, and create an account! From there, you can create your first note by using the tab at the top of the main Evernote window. Once complete, the note will be automatically synced with all of your devices that have the app installed! So easy. However, be weary because it does not work with incredibly large files—the name truly says it all and means it when it says “notes”!

## Brainstorming, Collaborating, and Communicating Visually
[toggle title="Bubbl Mind Mapping Tool"]
Sometimes (most of the time) it helps to just get your thoughts out onto paper. The best method for this varies from person to person. I personally like making ordered lists, others prefer the free write method. Mind Mapping is a brainstorm and organization tool for the more visual among us. It's essentially making a list, but with pretty bubbles all over the place.
## Bubbl
![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-28-at-3.28.16-PM.png)

This is a web app that allows you to create mind maps (up to 3 of them) using a fairly simple interface. Sign up for an account (you can use the + trick so you can easily filter emails from them in the future!), and start playing around.

Mind maps are based around bubbles. It's only a coincidence that Werner Bubbl got into the mind map software game, as his name so fits his choice of work. It's like how Lloyd Taco Bell started a Mexican food restaurant.

Each bubble represents a thought and then bubbles branch off from those thoughts. It's all about visualizing an idea.

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/How-to-create-a-mind-map-mindmap-1024x476.jpg)

In the above image, you can see how there is a central topic. Then there are general ideas coming off it, and in turn those ideas have sub-ideas.
## Try It Out
To test out this software, I thought about one of my current projects, making a contact database for Everett, and how it should look. So the central topic would be "Everett Database".

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bubbl_us___brainstorm_and_mind_map_online_31.png)

From there, I thought about some of the broad things that were direct consequents of this big topic. So I clicked the little button on the bottom that says, "New Child Bubble".

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bubbl_us___brainstorm_and_mind_map_online_2.png)

Ok now we're working with something. From there I started making more child bubbles of the child bubbles I already had.

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bubbl_us___brainstorm_and_mind_map_online_1.png)
## It's For Visual People
Like I said before, mind maps are just visually pleasing lists. That's not a disparaging remark about its impertinent fanciness. Just trying to make you a bit more aware of it from the conceptual side. Consider the mind map below

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-29-at-7.16.44-AM.png)

Now see it in list form:
<ul>
	<li>Everett Database
<ul>
	<li>Purpose
<ul>
	<li>Process event emails</li>
	<li>Keep track of alumni</li>
	<li>Stay organized</li>

# Padlet Collaboration
In keeping with this theme of more visual versions of stuff you already know, here is a fresh take on the Etherpad called, "Padlet".

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/padlet_blog_300.png)

&nbsp;

Go to [padlet.com](http://padlet.com/) and sign up for an account. Or don't. You can create a padlet right off the bat without signing in. At any rate, create a new pad and start playing around. Here are some beautifully short and concise clips that explain how to use it. You can find more of padlet's documentation at [padlet.com/features](http://padlet.com/features).
### Making Things

### Collaborators Working Simultaneously
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/61678462" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
### Upload Images and Such
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/61678416" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
## Sharing Your Pad
Just like with the Etherpad, you can just share the URL with someone else and they'll be able to collaborate with you!

If you create an account, you can modify the access settings so that only certain people can join the pad, or even password protect it!

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-29-at-7.43.58-AM.png)

Some people may be turned off by the...bland nature of Etherpad. Padlet offers a fresh, fun alternative. Whereas Etherpad is utilitarian and rigid, Padlet is expressive and creative.

[toggle title="Google Hangouts"]

Real time collaborative tools are very useful, but they can feel somewhat limiting in that they're all text and image based. Seeing the faces, body language, and tone of voice of the people you're working with is a very important component of collaboration. Since it's frequently not possible to be in the same physical space as your collaborators, we need to find a virtual solution.
# Google Hangouts
![image](http://www.homegrownandhappiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Google-Hangouts-logo.jpg)

Google is always renaming and consolidating their services. What used to be "Google Talk" and "GChat" have been rolled into "Google Hangouts" which is part of Google+, Google's social networking platform.

Hangouts allow you to do 2 things which we'll be talking about:
<ol>
	<li>Live text chat</li>
	<li>Live video chat</li>
</ol>
## Accessing Google Hangouts
This is a service offered to Google Apps users. As we've said before, your UCSC email is a Google Apps service so you automatically have it. Two years ago, UCSC accounts weren't allowed to use Google+ but since then ITS has enabled it for UCSC accounts so we can use this rad tool.
## Select the "+YourName" From the Google Apps Selector
![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Inbox__36__-_tgelder_ucsc_edu_-_UC_Santa_Cruz_Mail.png)

&nbsp;
## Click Through Till You're Set Up
If this is your first time using Google+, you'll probably have to slog through a bunch of screens prompting you to find friends, make a profile, build your homepage, etc. You can do that if you want, or just keep clicking continue to skip that stuff so you can get to the actual functionality. Once you've gotten to Google+, you can access hangouts.
# Once You're There: Text Chat
## Select "Hangouts" From The Left Menu Bar
Just below the serene looking banana slug will be a dropdown bar. Hover over it to expand it and then select "Hangouts"
<h2>![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Google__and_Edit_Post_‹_Everett_Labs_—_WordPress_and_Screenshots.png)Click the Little Quotation Mark Icon![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Google.png)</h2>
## Search For The Person You Want To Chat With
I'm searching for my personal account since I'm writing this alone and don't want to bother anyone. As you can see, I'm given a choice to either **message** or **video call. **We're going to select message first.

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Google1.png)
## Start Talking!
You can see here me talking with myself. This is what we call and "Instant Message". Just like AIM or Facebook Message. You can tie your Google Account in with [Adium](https://adium.im/) if you like having all your messaging channels tied in together.
<h1>![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Inbox__4__-_tomgelder_gmail_com_-_Gmail_and_Google1.png)
Once You're In: Video Calls</h1>
This is one of the most convenient things that Google Hangouts can offer. Free, real time, conference video calls. You can have a virtual meeting with up to 10 people!
## Select People
Search for the person or persons you like did before and check off each person you want participating in the call.

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Google2.png)
## Hit "Video Call"
The person(s) you're calling will get a notification that they're being called and can accept or decline it. Once they do, you're video chatting in real time! ![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-shot-2014-10-29-at-11.04.44-AM.png)

As you can see, the person I was talking to was a massive jerk and wasn't even looking into his camera.

# Some Really Cool Features Of Google Hangouts Video Chat
The video chat comes with some really useful features. They help you collaborate when their are a lot of voices in the room and can even help you act as if you're on the same computer! You can find these special features on the left toolbar. **You may have to download a component the first time you use some of these**.
## Effects
This first one is just for fun. Add silly props to your face! The yellow icon with the magic wand in front of it will bring up the effects.

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-shot-2014-10-29-at-11.13.36-AM.png)
## Text Chat
Yes things have gotten very inception-y. You may be in a video call with a bunch of people, but you can also text chat with them at the same time! This is actually really useful for doing things like:
<ul>
	<li>Proposing points of order</li>
	<li>Pasting links</li>
	<li>Asking for quick clarification that someone besides the speaker could answer</li>
</ul>
Just hit the blue chat bubble icon to bring up the chat window.
## Screen Sharing
This one is really cool and I only just found out about it. You can allow the person you're chatting with access to your screen. That is, they can use your mouse, open stuff, etc. It's really helpful for troubleshooting. I can see this being very helpful in helping your grandma use the computer when you're away.

## Correspond with People Back Home
Show your mom how to use Google Hangouts and you can talk anytime! You don't call your poor mother enough.

# Working Together
The heart and soul of a good project is collaboration, and that's what we want you to get out of this assignment. Pursuant with that, we want to see you guys planning out what to do.
## Let Us See Your Discussion
Create a new [Etherpad](http://labs.everettprogram.org/classes/tech-essentials/lesson-2/#etherpad) to be used for your group discussion.
### Online Tool Discussion
Over the past four lessons, you've learned a ridiculous amount of new tools. Now's the time to put them into action!

Create a section on the etherpad and call it "**Online Tool Discussion**". In this section you're going to discuss the individual tools that you want to use to organize your volunteers.

How will you get people in the same room at the same time? Are there materials to share? How will you communicate with them? How will they communicate with each other? These are the kinds of questions to talk about. Discuss with each other what you're hoping to accomplish in terms of organizing and how you hope to accomplish these things.
### Online Tools
In another section of the Etherpad called "**Online Tools"**, list clearly **5 tools** that you will use to accomplish your goals.

Decide on 5 "tools" (Mailing lists, collaboration platforms, etc) that you think will help you accomplish your goals and explain why you think each of these is the right tool for the job.

Also include, next to the tool's name, the name of the person who would be responsible for managing that particular tool.
#### Be Organized In Your Discussion
Please make your discussion clear. Use headings, bullet points, etc. in order to make it clear what y'all are trying to say.
### What To Turn In For This Portion
Please take a screenshot (cropped to include the vital information and not your entire computer screen) of the following:
<ol>
	<li>The URL for your group Etherpad</li>
	<li>The "Online Tool Discussion" section</li>
	<li>The "Online Tools" section</li>
</ol>
Label all three with the typical naming convention we've been using i.e.: <strong>Firstname.Lastname.<wbr />Group#.Etherpad.MidtermTE.png</strong>
# Dummy Email
We'd like to see an example of an email that you would send to your volunteers. You are going to, as a group of course, compose a dummy email.
## What to Include In The Email
Organize it how you see fit, just make sure to include the following stuff:
<ul>
	<li>The names of the people in your team</li>
	<li>A warning that this will be a long email and a plea to read the whole thing</li>
	<li>An explanation of what you're trying to achieve</li>
	<li>The links to the final product and why they should fill it out/use the tool
<ul>
	<li>i.e. how it will help their local project</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Include images and attachments if it needed</li>
	<li>Resources that would help them in completeing their task</li>
	<li>How to contact you (the team) for more help</li>
	<li>A Thank You section relating
<ul>
	<li>Your appreciation for their time</li>
	<li>Reassurance that they can contact you for help</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
### A Signatures Section. Include:
<ul>
	<li>Your names and emails. Have your name be a hyperlink to your email, but only show your name.
<ul>
	<li>Example: [Aaron Longa](mailto:mlonga@ucsc.edu)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
### Links to various Amnesty International Pages.
As always, use pretty links. By that we mean, turn actual words into hyperlinks, don't just paste in full URLs.
<ul>
	<li>**Coo**l: [Amnesty International](http://www.amnestyusa.org/)</li>
	<li>**Not Cool**: [http://www.amnestyusa.org/](http://www.amnestyusa.org/)</li>
</ul>
#### Links to Include
<ul>
	<li>Amnesty International's Homepage</li>
	<li>The Amnesty International campaign page associated with your group</li>
</ul>
### Pro-Tip: Format For Clarity
You want them to understand you, right? A big part of getting your point across is good formatting. Here's things to consider:
<ul>
	<li>Using bold headers</li>
	<li>Bullet points</li>
	<li>Italicization</li>
	<li>Bigger font size in titles where needed</li>
	<li>Links to the tools you are using</li>
