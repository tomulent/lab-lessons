<h3>Outcomes For This Lesson</h3>
This week we will look at three separate aspects that involve creating an online presence, managing a team of collaborators, and getting involved/gaining insight about an issue. You will be introduced to web design through the free and open source WordPress tool, to project management through a free project management tool called Asana, and to online activism through three platforms for organizing online petitions that aim at creating change in some way or another.
<h3><strong>Why this is important for your project/ Context</strong></h3>
Project managers often work with a team of people that are not always able to meet in person due to physical restrictions. We have already seen how collaborative tools can be very useful such as for example those used when editing documents . Today we'll look into how to delegate tasks to project team members.

We have repeatedly emphasized the importance of creating an online presence through social media in this lab. In this lesson we take the idea of online presence one step  further as we discuss why a website is fundamental in getting your message across to a larger audience.

Ultimately, we briefly discuss online activism in this lesson. Being busy students, some of us might wonder how to get involved in an issue, or how to find information about what is being done concerning an issue. Knowing about platforms for online activism can mitigate this gap, but may also have it's pitfalls.

[toggle title="Project Management Defined"]

Project management is the application of processes, methods, knowledge, skills and experience to achieve the project objectives.
A project is a unique endeavor, undertaken to achieve planned objectives, which could be defined in terms of outputs, outcomes or benefits. A project is usually deemed to be a success if it achieves the objectives according to their acceptance criteria, within an agreed timescale and budget.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jk-JwtScIlw" width="669" height="407" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<h3>5 core components of project management are:</h3>
<h4>1. Project conception and initiation</h4>
An idea for a project will be carefully examined to determine whether or not it benefits the organization. During this phase, a decision making team will identify if the project can realistically be completed.
<h4>2. Project definition and planning</h4>
A project plan, project charter and/or project scope may be put in writing, outlining the work to be performed. During this phase, a team should prioritize the project, calculate a budget and schedule, and determine what resources are needed.
<h4>3. Project launch or execution</h4>
Resources' tasks are distributed and teams are informed of responsibilities. This is a good time to bring up important project related information.
<h4>4. Project performance and control</h4>
Project managers will compare project status and progress to the actual plan, as resources perform the scheduled work. During this phase, project managers may need to adjust schedules or do what is necessary to keep the project on track.
<h4>5. Project close</h4>
After project tasks are completed and the client has approved the outcome, an evaluation is necessary to highlight project success and/or learn from project history.

Projects and project management processes vary from industry to industry; however, these are more traditional elements of a project. The overarching goal is typically to offer a product, change a process or to solve a problem in order to benefit the organization.

[toggle title="Asana"]

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://asana.com">Asana</a> is a web and mobile application designed to help teams track their work. It was founded in 2008 by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and ex-engineer Justin Rosenstein, who both worked on improving the productivity of employees at Facebook. Asana is free to use for up to 15 team members, and although paid versions have some added features you can manage a project  professionally and successfully without paying a cent which makes it a perfect tool for small orgs. Asana allows the entire team to co-create and organize projects together.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Get started with Asana by going to </span><a href="http://asana.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asana.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and sign up for an account. </span>

As a new Asana member you will start by creating a new 'Work Space'. Click on your profile picture or icon in the top-right corner and select Create New Workspace. Give this space a name that will represent the group, company, or organization that you work with.

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Create-New-WorkSpace1.png"><img class="  wp-image-6557 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Create-New-WorkSpace1.png" alt="Create New WorkSpace" width="352" height="442" /></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can select team-members at this point by adding their email addresses, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but you can also add members at any point later in the process.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a Project</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have created a Workspace, you can create an infinite number of projects for your group to tackle. </span>

To create a new project, open the menu in the top right corner...

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Open-menu1.png"><img class="  wp-image-6558 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Open-menu1.png" alt="Open menu" width="479" height="121" /></a>

...and select create new project from the menu:

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Asana-Create-New-Project.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-6559 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Asana-Create-New-Project.png" alt="Asana Create New Project" width="239" height="481" /></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, at this point you can also add team members through the “who is missing from my team” function. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can add multiple projects within each created Workspace, so by giving the project a descriptive name and adding some details about the project, team members can easily get a grasp of what the project entails.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it is time to delegate tasks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By clicking on your named project in the side menu, the main frame turns into a task management tool.</span>

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Asana-Add-Task.png"><img class="  wp-image-6561 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Asana-Add-Task.png" alt="Asana Add Task" width="585" height="192" /></a>

Your projects can be divided into into Sections based on category, workflow stage, or priority using Sections, an option that appears when you hover over the ‘Add Task’ button.

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Create-Section1.png"><img class="  wp-image-6562 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Create-Section1.png" alt="Create Section" width="550" height="279" /></a>

&nbsp;

Further, by selecting one of the team members, you (or any other member) can assign a task to a specific person (including yourself).

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Assign-Task1.png"><img class="  wp-image-6564 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Assign-Task1.png" alt="Assign Task" width="546" height="188" /></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can add detail to the task by using the panel to the top right of the task-management tool:</span>

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Assigned-task-details1.png"><img class="  wp-image-6566 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Assigned-task-details1.png" alt="Assigned task details" width="416" height="68" /></a>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can:</span>
<ol>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assign a due-date to the task</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell your team members you love the task (where's the 'I detest the task'-button)</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add a tag (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tag</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a label that can be attached to any task in Asana. You can use this to create filtered views across several projects)</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add a sub-task</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attach a file to the task</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select from the drop-down menu that allows you to:</span>
<ol>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delete task</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a copy of the task</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convert the task to a project</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Print the task</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merge multiple tasks</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
You can also add a comment to any task you have been assigned or that have been assigned to others. You can add insights about a task, copy and paste links that may be useful etc.

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Asana-add-comment.png"><img class="  wp-image-6572 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Asana-add-comment.png" alt="Asana - add comment" width="483" height="228" /></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By selecting the “view by” dropdown menu in the top right corner of the task-list you can select which tasks you want to view at any given time:</span>

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/View1.png"><img class="  wp-image-6567 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/View1.png" alt="View" width="464" height="286" /></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To get an overview of the due dates for the various tasks click on ‘team calendar’ in the left menu, and a calendar displaying tasks appear in the main panel.</span>

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/calendar-view1.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-6568 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/calendar-view1.png" alt="calendar view" width="468" height="432" /></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a task has been completed, click on the checkmark next to the task. This will cause the checkmark to turn green, signaling to team members that the task has been done.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Please watch this </span><a href="https://youtu.be/1XTqHBaU3Qs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube tutorial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get a feel of how larger projects with multiple team members can be managed using Asana.</span>

[toggle title="What is WordPress?"]

<span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress (WP) is an </span><a href="http://www.opensource.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Source</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project, which means there are hundreds of people all over the world working on it. (More than most commercial platforms.) It also means you are free to use it for anything from your recipe site to a Fortune 500 web site without paying anyone a license fee </span><a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and a number of other important freedoms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<a href="http://wordpress.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open source WordPress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the most popular online publishing platform, currently powering more than 20% of the web. Although the downloadable WP software is free you would need to purchase a domain and pay a hosting service to publish your website this way. BUT,  in order to bring the WordPress experience to an even larger audience, the absolutely free online  </span><a href="https://wordpress.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was created in 2005.This is a hosted version of the open source software where you can start a blog or build a website in seconds without any technical knowledge and absolutely free.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the WordPress.com network welcomes more than 409 million people viewing more than 15.5 billion pages each month. WP users publish about 41.7 million new posts and leave 60.5 million new comments each month. Click </span><a href="https://wordpress.com/activity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more WP stats, and a pretty cool real-time map of WordPress activity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost everything on WordPress.com is free, and what’s currently free will remain so in the future. The sites are kept  free by offering upgrades for things like </span><a href="http://store.wordpress.com/plans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://store.wordpress.com/premium-upgrades/custom-domains/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">custom domains</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as products like </span><a href="http://akismet.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anti-spam software Akismet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://vip.wordpress.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VIP hosting partnerships</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with major media outlet.</span>

[toggle title="Set Up Your Free WordPress Domain"]

Go to <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> and click on Create Website.

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/WordPress_com__Create_a_free_website_or_blog.png"><img class="  wp-image-6489 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/WordPress_com__Create_a_free_website_or_blog.png" alt="WordPress_com__Create_a_free_website_or_blog" width="575" height="363" /></a>

At the next step you can pick a template. This is the layout you want your webpage to have. If you are not ready to pick a template yet, just click the Skip button as you can pick your template later.

Whether you prefer to pick a template or skip it at this point, the next page you get to looks like this:

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Create_an_account_—_WordPress_com.png"><img class="  wp-image-6490 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Create_an_account_—_WordPress_com.png" alt="Create_an_account_—_WordPress_com" width="614" height="418" /></a>

This is where you will choose your domain name. Pick something that is relevant to what you are going to use the site for. In my case I chose 'changeit' because my page will showcase an issue and how one can get digitally involved in mitigating it by signing petitions on <a href="http://www.change.org">change.org</a>.

As you can see my domain name then become changeit284.wordpress.com, so due to being absolutely free I'll have to be okay with not getting exactly what I most desire ... which I am :)

When you are content with the name option, go ahead and click 'Select' next to that wonderful 'Free' sign, and voila; you are now the proud owner of your personal website URL.

[toggle title="How to Get Started With WordPress"]

Before you get started, here's a quick note on how to get to your 'Dashboard' which is where you will do all the editing for your site. Most tutorials are geared towards the .org version, so this step is often not explained:

You get to the dashboard by going to<strong> yoursite.wordpress.com/wp-admin </strong>(example: changit148.wordpress.com/wp-admin. Log in with your username and password. If you are already logged in, you can scroll down to the bottom of your page and access Dashboard from the <strong>'Site Admin'</strong> button, or simply write /wp-admin behind your domain name URL.

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/changeit148-admin.png"><img class="  wp-image-6511 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/changeit148-admin.png" alt="changeit148 admin" width="235" height="197" /></a>

This is what the Dashboard look like:

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Dashboard_‹_Change-It__—_WordPress.png"><img class="  wp-image-6541 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Dashboard_‹_Change-It__—_WordPress.png" alt="Dashboard_‹_Change-It__—_WordPress" width="365" height="396" /></a>

&nbsp;

From the Dashboard (the back-end) you can easily get back to the actual site (the front-end) through clicking MySite in the top right corner, and then View Site

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Dashboard_-MySite_‹_Change-It__—_WordPress.png"><img class="  wp-image-6543 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Dashboard_-MySite_‹_Change-It__—_WordPress.png" alt="Dashboard_-MySite_‹_Change-It__—_WordPress" width="344" height="217" /></a>

&nbsp;

Below the View Site button there is also a menu that will allow you to perform several (though far from all) of the tasks you can do through the Dashboard. Besides having more functions on the Dashboard, another benefit to using it is that if you continue learning WordPress through the Everett Program Labs (or elsewhere) all the work will be done through dashboard. Also, the absolute majority of external tutorials teach how to access functions through use of the Dashboard.

&nbsp;

The following tutorial will give you an overview of several functions and processes when creating a WordPress site.  Since it is geared towards the version of WordPress that requires you to purchase a domain name (wordpress.org), the tutorial also has some information about plugins that is obsolete for our uses, since downloading plugins isn't possible through wordpress.com. No need to despair though, several highly useful plugins are incorporated in the version we are using, and available through the widgets section, but more on that later. The tutorial ends with a business-pitch that I'll just ask you to disregard.

[toggle title="WordPress Themes"]

The WordPress theme is the design that determines the visual aspects of your website such as color and layout.  It controls the number of columns, the font of the title, the size of the website, and much more.  By default, WordPress comes with a theme, however there are thousands of other themes available on your Dashbord or online that you can use as well if the default theme does not fit your needs.

There are many places that you can get WordPress themes.  You can find themes at the official WordPress site, from within the WordPress Dashboard itself, and other websites around the Internet.  Some other websites will charge money for you to use their theme, while others are free.

If you didn't already choose a theme during the signup process, this is  a good time to do so. For this exercise we'll pick from one of the themes readily available to us through our Dashboard Menu.

Hover over <strong>'Apparances' </strong>in the left side bar, and click on on<strong> 'Themes'.</strong>

You may be okay with the theme that is automatically given you, but you may also want to customize your site so that it fits your needs and sense of aesthetics better.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you start scrolling down the list of themes, you'll notice that this is one of the ways WP makes money so that they can continue offering this cool service for free to the masses. The themes that doesn’t have a price tag attached to them are, however, free, so go ahead and pick one you like, and that fits your idea of how you’d like to present your material. To make the pick between the free ones easier (and to avoid being tempted by some of the for-$ ones, you can choose only to see the free ones by clicking the button that says <em>Free</em> in the top right corner</span>

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Manage_Themes_‹_changeit148_—_WordPress.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-6512 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Manage_Themes_‹_changeit148_—_WordPress.png" alt="Manage_Themes_‹_changeit148_—_WordPress" width="368" height="76" /></a>

Pick the theme you think will best fit your needs and click Preview<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Try-and-Customize—_WordPress_com.png">
</a>

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Manage_Themes_previewchangeit148_—_WordPress.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-6513 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Manage_Themes_previewchangeit148_—_WordPress.png" alt="Manage_Themes_previewchangeit148_—_WordPress" width="352" height="90" /></a>

This step will allow you to see what the site will look like after you add your own touch to it. The left side panel has drop down menus that shows you what areas of your page you can make changes to such as the image, title etc. Play around with it to see what the specific theme can do for you. Once you are convinced this is a good theme for you click <strong>'Save and Activate'</strong>.

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Theme_save_and_activate_—_WordPress_com.png"><img class="  wp-image-6503 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Theme_save_and_activate_—_WordPress_com.png" alt="Theme_save_and_activate_—_WordPress_com" width="465" height="484" /></a>

You can change your theme later as well without loosing the work you have done on your site. If you end up in this situation, use the <strong>'Preview' </strong>option to make sure your previous work will be a good fit with the new theme before you change it.

[toggle title="A Few Useful General Settings"]

In <em>General Settings </em>you can change the site title (or else it will be identical with your domain name), add a tagline (to tell your audience a little about what your site is all about), and preform some general house cleaning such as setting correct timezone and deciding how to display time and date.

The reading settings will determine how the content on your page is made available to the audience, once someone go to your domain name.

[toggle title="Creating Menus, Pages, and Posts"]

Most WP themes come with a default menu that includes the menu items <em>"About" and "Home". </em>Depending on the content of your web-site you might want to change these to menu-items that reflect the given content on the individual pages you will create. A word of caution here about the cluttered and overwhelming feel that comes along with a webpage that has way too many main-menu items. Try to limit them to somewhere between 6 and 10 (at the most), 8 being a sweet-spot for many. Read this <a href="http://wiredimpact.com/blog/4-pages-your-nonprofit-website-should-include/" target="_blank">article</a> to find out which 4 pages should definitely be part of any webpage whose purpose is spurring some type of social action.

You will add videos through copying and pasting the embed-html code into the text editor which is different from the visual editor where you write your content and add pictures.

Adding links to your site is very straight forward. Within the buttons in the visual editor is a 'link button'. Click this, then inert the URL you want the link to lead to, and the text you want the link to display on your site.

[toggle title="Plugins and Widgets"]

A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website. They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language and integrate seamlessly with WordPress. In the WordPress community, there is a saying that goes around: “there’s a plugin for that”. They makes it easy for users to add features to their website without knowing a single line of code. There are thousands available for free to download at the <a title="WordPress plugin directory" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">official WordPress plugin directory</a>.

Plugins are, however,  only applicable to self-hosted blogs and web sites using the WordPress.org software. <strong>Plugins are not permitted at WordPress.com</strong> for various security reasons. But despair not, the most popular plugin functionality is included within the wordpress.com sites automatically.

A WordPress Widget is a small block that performs a specific function. You can add these widgets in <a title="What is a Sidebar" href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/sidebar/">sidebars</a> also known as widget-ready areas on your web page.

WordPress widgets were originally created to provide a simple and easy-to-use way of giving design and structure control of the WordPress theme to the user. Widgets can be easily dragged and dropped into a specific widget area. You can find the list of available widgets and widget areas by going to the <strong>Appearance » Widgets</strong> section in your WordPress dashboard.

[toggle title="Twitter Timeline Widget"]

Twitter offers embeddable timelines that allow you to display any public Twitter feed on your blog. These timelines are interactive, so readers can reply, retweet and favorite tweets straight from your blog or website.

By linking your Twitter Feed  to the website you let your visitors get a broader perspective on who you are, what you are passionate about, and what you tweet about regularly. It can also be a great way of amassing followers if you are so inclined.

Your Twitter timeline is linked to your website through a specific widget. The first thing you need to do is to create a Twitter timeline ID.
<h2>Get Your Twitter Widget ID</h2>
<div class="entrytext">

First, open your Twitter account, and click on the small profile picture in the top right corner. Select <strong>'Settings'</strong> from the drop down menu.

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Twitter-settings.png"><img class="  wp-image-6520 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Twitter-settings.png" alt="Twitter settings" width="471" height="503" /></a>

Next click on <strong>'Widgets'</strong> in the left side-bar, and select <strong>'Create New'</strong>.

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Create-Twitter-Widget-1-.png"><img class="  wp-image-6521 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Create-Twitter-Widget-1-.png" alt="Create Twitter Widget 1" width="514" height="362" /></a>

There, you can pick your color scheme and size your Twitter widget. Once you’re done, click <strong>'Create Widget'</strong>.

<img class="  wp-image-6519 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Widgets_Configurator.png" alt="Widgets_Configurator" width="578" height="442" />

Your widget ID is the long number you see in the URL while editing your Twitter widget.

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Widgets_Configurator-number.png"><img class="  wp-image-6522 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Widgets_Configurator-number.png" alt="Widgets_Configurator number" width="588" height="33" /></a>

</div>
&nbsp;

Copy and paste this number into the Twitter widget editor that you will access through your websites dashboard like by clicking 'Appearance', 'Widgets', scroll down and click 'Twitter Timeline', and lastly choose where you want the twitter feed to appear (which footer, or sidebar). Finish this step by clicking <strong>'Add Widget'</strong>.

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Widgets_Twitter-Timeline.png"><img class="  wp-image-6524 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Widgets_Twitter-Timeline.png" alt="Widgets_Twitter Timeline" width="446" height="475" /></a>

&nbsp;

Next you will be given some options. Insert your Twitter Feed ID as indicated, and make changes to how you want the feed to appear on your page.

<a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Widget-Twitter-timeline-options.png"><img class="  wp-image-6525 aligncenter" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Widget-Twitter-timeline-options.png" alt="Widget Twitter timeline options" width="438" height="882" /></a>

There are more ways to play around with twitter (and other social media) on your website. Check out this article to learn more:

<a href="http://sproutsocial.com/insights/embed-twitter-feed/">4 Ways to Add Twitter Feeds to Your Website</a>

One way is by adding <a href="https://about.twitter.com/resources/buttons#tweet">Twitter Buttons</a>. If you choose to do this, you must make sure that you paste the code into the appropriate place on Dashboard, namely in your text editor, and not in the visual tab where we are doing all the work of writing pages, adding media etc.

<h1>Online Activism</h1>
[toggle title="Online Activism"]

Internet activism (also known as online activism, digital campaigning, digital activism<i>,</i> online organizing, electronic advocacy, cyber-activism, e-campaigning, and e-activism) is the use of electronic communication technologies such as social media, especially Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, e-mail, and podcasts for various forms of activism to enable faster communication by citizen movements and the delivery of local information to a large audience. Internet technologies are used for cause-related fundraising, community building, lobbying, organizing, and petitions. Research has started to address specifically how activist/advocacy groups in the<span style="font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 18.1818px;"> </span>are using social media to achieve digital activism objectives.

Check out this <a href="https://srogers.cartodb.com/viz/4a5eb582-23ed-11e4-bd6b-0e230854a1cb/embed_map">awesome map</a> about how news of #Ferguson spread across twitter!

The tools used by digital activists are vast and the list changes constantly in line with the rapid general evolution of technology. The following list is from <a href="http://en.reset.org/knowledge/digital-and-online-activism">this article</a>.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Online petitions</strong>. Websites such as <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.change.org/" target="_blank">Change.org</a> and <a class="ext-link" href="http://front.moveon.org/" target="_blank">MoveOn.org</a> are hubs of online activism, where people can communicate with others worldwide regarding their cause. MoveOn.org initially grew from a small petition that two Silicon Valley entrepreneurs sent to some family and friends in the late ‘90s, asking for their support in telling the White House to “move on” from the Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky scandal to more pressing issues facing the country. Another platform is <a href="http://coworker.org">coworker.org</a>, a non-profit organization launched in 2013 as a global platform for engaging in workplace advocacy. Our technology makes it easy for individuals or groups of employees to launch, join and win campaigns to improve their workplace.</li>
	<li><strong>Social networks.</strong> Sites with high usage numbers such as Facebook and YouTube have proven beneficial in spreading a message, garnering support, shining information on a subject that might otherwise be overlooked by mainstream media. Protests in 2011 in Tunisia and Egypt against their respective governments were in part organised and promoted via Facebook.</li>
	<li><strong>Blogs.</strong> Essentially a form of citizen journalism for the masses, blogs provide an effective means of non-filtered communication with an audience about any topic and have been used in numerous online campaigns.</li>
	<li><strong>Micro-blogging.</strong> Micro-blogging sites such as Twitter are used to help spread awareness of an issue or activist event. Twitter's hashtag function, which allows people to have their tweets contribute to a multi-user conversation by typing a keyword or phrase preceded by a hashtag, is used frequently as a digital tool for spreading a message. The Chinese equivalent to Twitter, Weibo is subject to scrupulous government censorship however people circumvent this blockade by using code words when writing about issues that might be government-sensitive.</li>
	<li><strong>Mobile phones.</strong> Controversy surrounding the 2007 presidential elections in Kenya led to the introduction of <a class="ext-link" href="http://ushahidi.com/" target="_blank">Ushahidi Inc.,</a> a company which developed a piece of software that allowed people to send texts and pictures of violence following the elections which were plotted geographically on a Google map. The software has since been used to plot activity in disaster zones following earthquakes in Haiti and New Zealand and flooding in Australia and the USA.</li>
	<li><strong>Proxy servers.</strong> As a means of circumventing government intervention when it comes to online protesting, many people employ proxy servers, which act as intermediaries between a user and a site, thus essentially circumventing national restrictions on any site. In 2009, student protesters in Iran took to social media to voice their concern over the contentious reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. This led to a cat and mouse game of the government trying to identify which media were being used by the protesters to communicate (social networks and then eventually proxy servers) and shutting them down.</li>
</ul>
In this lesson we will focus on online petitions because it is an excellent way to get the message 'out there' by creating awareness around an issue, and in the process hopefully creating the political pressure necessary to spur change.

Here is an article that highlights <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/changeorg-petitions_n_5672777.html">10 Internet Petitions That Helped The Little Guy Beat The System</a>. By going to the individual sites of <a href="http://change.org">change.org</a>, <a href="http://moveon.org">moveon.org</a>, and <a href="http://coworker.org">coworker.org</a> one can also look over success stories; incidents when petition actually achieved the intended goal.

The following video is about impact achieved through change.org petitions:

While discussing online activism it is, however, important to warn of the dangers of succumbing to 'clicktivism' as the only form of activism one pursuits. It is an easy way to get involved but it does not mitigate the need for actual people doing actual work in the actual world. <a href="http://elitedaily.com/news/technology/empty-clicks-online-activism-often-meaningless/1093302/">This article</a> address some of these issues.

Lastly this video will give an overview of what the evolution of social media and online activism looks like worldwide.

<h1 id="theproject">The Project</h1>
This is a larger lesson and assignment than what has been the norm for the lab this quarter. As discussed in class you will have 2 weeks to complete the project since, and it will be due December 3rd.

In this lesson you have learned about building a free website with WordPress, utilizing Asana to manage a team of collaborators, and a little about how to access online petitions and their potential to spur social change.

The purpose of this project is to sew these three seemingly unrelated items together into a project that will ultimately increase your confidence and competence in all three arenas.

You will be creating a social movement. You will create a website, using free tools, to highlight a social issue. This site will offer visitors clear ways to effect change through use of free online petition platforms. To make sure that the team is working well together and everyone knows what they are expected to do after your sites are done, you’ll be using free online project/team management tools.
<h1 id="parti-wordpressandonlineactivism">Part I - WordPress and Online Activism</h1>
<h3 id="createawebsiteonwordpress.com">Create a Website on WordPress.com</h3>
Your movement needs a home. Create your very own website through <a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a>.

This website is going to highlight an issue you are passionate about. Any social issue is fine, but make sure you can find three petitions that concern this issue on change.org, moveon.org, coworker.org, or a combination of the three.
<h2>Theme</h2>
Select and activate the TwentyTwelve theme for your website (If you prefer another template you can change it as soon as you've received a grade for this project).
<h2 id="sitecustumizations">Site Custumizations</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Change the <strong>Site Title</strong> and <strong>Site Tagline</strong> to something that has to do with your site’s social issue</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pages">Pages</h2>
<h3 id="infopage">Info Page</h3>
Create one <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Pages">Page</a> that highlights the issue you have chosen to focus on. This page will have just some general information about the issue so that someone who is not familiar with it can learn more. You must include:
<ul>
	<li>At least one <strong>video</strong> or <strong>image</strong></li>
	<li>At least one written paragraph explaining what the issue is.This isn’t a writing class, so feel free to copy from somewhere else (Wikipedia, a related site, etc.). Just be sure to credit the original</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="onlinepetitioningpage">Online Petitioning Page</h3>
Create a page that briefly explains what online petitioning is. Include:
<ul>
	<li>An image or infographic</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="posts">Posts</h2>
WordPress has <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Pages">Page</a>, which are for static, unchanging content. Think of things like “About Us”, “Mission Statment”, “Contact”, etc. WordPress also has <strong>Posts</strong>, which are basically blog posts. They have categories and tags and can be read one after another. You’ll be making several posts for this project.
<h3 id="issueexampleposts">Issue Example Posts</h3>
Create <strong>two</strong> posts that each provide an example of your issue. Each of these posts should include:
<ul>
	<li>At least one image or video</li>
	<li>At least one written paragraph that adresses the issue. Again, you can copy paste, but please give credit by adding a link to the original material.</li>
	<li>Give each post the <strong>category</strong>, “YOUR ISSUE Posts”</li>
</ul>
For an example, refer to <a href="https://changeit148.wordpress.com/category/uncategorized/petition-posts/">My Example Site</a>. I have a static front page, and a menu item that brings you to my Child Labor Posts. Follow the link and you’ll see my posts on child labor. Two separate posts, each with media, and categorized as “Child Labor Posts”.
<h3 id="petitionposts">Petition Posts</h3>
Find <strong>three</strong> petitions on sites like <a href="https://www.change.org">change.org</a>, <a href="https://www.coworker.org">coworker.org</a>, or <a href="http://front.moveon.org">moveon.org</a>. Get them from any combination of the three, it doesn’t matter.

Create a <strong>post</strong> for <em>each individual petition</em>. You’ll basically be featuring these campaigns. Copy the <strong>text</strong> of the campaign and paste it into your post. Be sure to <strong>link</strong> back to the original petition in the post.
<ul>
	<li>Give each post the categories “Petition Posts”.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="menus">Menus</h2>
Finally, people need to be able to navigate your website. That’s why WordPress gave us the custom menu. In <strong>Appearance &gt; Menus</strong> create a new menu and give it the following items:
<ul>
	<li>Your Issue Page
<ul>
	<li>Your Issues Posts
<ul>
	<li>This is a category rather than a page</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Your Online Petitions Page
<ul>
	<li>Your Petitions Posts Category</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
The items indented are <strong>Sub Items</strong>, that is, they appear when you mouse over their parent menu item. See the <a href="https://changeit148.wordpress.com">example site</a> and this image taken of the menu editor.
<img id="image" title="" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/Menus_final-layout-1.png" alt="image" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hint: watch the tutorial on creating pages, posts, and menus in the lesson. </span>

Check out <a href="https://changeit148.wordpress.com">this website</a> I created about the issue of Child Labor for hints of what we'll be looking for when we are grading this assignment.
