By using RSS, you don't have to manually check all the websites and blogs you follow. We highly recommend checking out the various options and choosing one that works well for you.
<h2>Web Apps</h2>

Feedly is a wonderfully intuitive newsreader that can display your subscriptions in a number of ways from lists to tiles to magazine style. It's easy to use, lives in your browser, and has an excellent mobile app for iOS and Android. Lots of social sharing options.

<h2>Your Browser</h2>
Both Safari and Firefox have built in methods of handling RSS subscriptions.
<h3>Firefox</h3>
Just clicking an RSS feed link (or visiting it) will take you to the Firefox RSS manager. There you can choose what to do with the feed.

 You'll see the really simplified version of your blog feed at the bottom. Up at the top, you can choose what to do with the feed. Send it to your Google RSS Reader, or the Yahoo Reader. You can send it to other RSS applications like Apple Mail, or other ones (see below). Firefox also has a simple bookmarks folder called "Live Bookmarks" that functions as a reader.
<h3>Safari</h3>
Go to Preferences&gt;RSS to set the behavior of RSS links. Usually it will just send it to the Apple Mail application on your computer. Newer versions of Safari might do things differently.
<h2>Desktop Apps</h2>
<h3>Apple Mail</h3>
If you use Mail to manage your email, then it's a great idea to also send your RSS feeds to Mail.
<h3>MS Outlook</h3>
Same deal. If you use Outlook as your mail client, then consider setting this as your default RSS reader
