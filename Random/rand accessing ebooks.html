<h1>Accessing eBooks</h1>
The UC library system is one of the biggest, well-funded research resources in the world. You have access to a huge amount of journals, online databases, books as part of your tuition. One of the most underutilized resources are ebooks. This is mainly because there are extra steps you must go through to access them. It's easy to get frustrated and say 'forget it', but the reward for sticking through it once is very high. For that purpose, we'll help you out here.
<h2>Activating Your Card</h2>
In order to access libary resources when not on campus, you'll need to use "Off Campus Access" or OCA. Before you can do that, you'll need to have your library card "Activated". If you haven't done this before, you can consult <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/services/off-campus-access-faq">this handy guide</a> from the library. Basically you just need to either go in and ask the circulation desk (the place where you check out books) or call them at <code>831-459-5185</code>. Once you've done this, you can use OCA.
<h2>Find The Book You Want</h2>
For purposes of this guide, we'll look up a couple CiviCRM books.
<h3>Sign In Through OCA (If You're Off Campus)</h3>

Input your 12 digit library card number. That's everything after the <code>222000</code> or whatever.
<h3>Select CruzCat To Do A Search</h3>

If you didn't use OCA, just go to the normal CruzCat search

<h3>Search for "CiviCRM Cookbook".</h3>
This is a neat book full of rather straightforward solutions to common problems and a lot of tips and tricks.
<h3>Click on "Connect To This Online"</h3>

<h3>Create An Account</h3>
Click "Sign In" and then create an account. You probably have to do this with your UCSC email.
<h3>Download the Book!</h3>
Or read it online. Your choice.
<h3>Read It With Adobe Digital Editions</h3>
The file that downloads is a PDF, but it's loaded up with some fancy DRM (Digital Rights Management) that prevents you from using Preview or Adobe Reader. You'll need an application set up to handle this type of file. I've found Adobe Digital Editions to work very well for this. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html">Download Here</a>.
<h2>Accessing eBooks Through Melvyl</h2>
Melvly is the UC-wide (and beyond) library search engine. I recommend using it over CruzCat, because its interface is better and it won't lead you to believe a book is not available. If the book is present anywhere in our network, you can just make an Inter Library Loan (ILL) request and have it shipped here. That said, it took me an embarassingly long time to figure out how to access eBooks and I'm a researcher!
<h3>Click On The Entry You Want</h3>
I did a Melvyl search for "CiviCRM" and got a result called, <em>Using CiviCRM : develop and implement a fully-functional, systematic CRM plan for your organization using CiviCRM</em>. Click on the link and you'll be taken to its listing page.
