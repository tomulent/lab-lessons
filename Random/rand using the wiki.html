As part of your Practical Tech assignment, you were asked to post your findings on the Everett Program Wiki. You probably asked yourself, "What's that and how?" Well wonder no more, because here we go.
## Go to wiki.everettprogram.org
We created a subdomain on everettprogram.org and then installed a free, open source wiki application called "DokuWiki". We chose this because it's simple and very light-weight. We tested out MediaWiki, the platform that Wikipedia uses, but it was a little too robust for our needs. It was very slow and ate up a lot of server resources. DokuWiki is much simpler as it was designed for software development teams to quickly create project documentation.
## Sign In Using the Credentials Emailed to You
You should have received an email from the wiki with your username and password. Login with these. Feel free to change your password to something you can actually remember. Just make sure it's secure.
## Enter the Practical Tech Section and Find Your Tech
The tech director has graciously created a page for all the technologies listed in the assignment, so just click on yours. Notice that all (or most) of the links are red. This is because they're all "stubs".
### Stubs
Wiki's are unlike a Content Management System in that every new page has to originate in another page. With a CMS like WordPress, you can hit a button to create a new page or post, then worry about where to put the link to it afterword. With this Wiki, the only way to create a page is to create a page link in the text of another
## Create The Page!
Click on the pencil icon on the right to open up the editor. It says "Create Page" rather than "Edit Page" because there's no content yet.

See those equals signs? That will make the text into a level 1 heading. The dashes will make those lines into ordered list items. Once you save, it will look like this:

# Making Links
Please don't forget to make your links actually function! The formatting bar at the top of the editor has a link button.

# Make This Wiki Yours
Not, like, yours as an individual, but yours as a class. Want to write about new tech you've found? Create a page! The wiki was created for community, so be active citizens of that community!
