Google Docs allows you to collaborate with other individuals while working on the same document. If you've ever gotten on a group study guide for a midterm or final, then you're probably familiar with this. Google Docs allow you to openly collaborate, edit, comment, and work with others in real-time. As long as you have Internet connection, using Google Docs to work together on an assignment, share ideas, or create a presentation for class is a useful tool because this can be done from the comfort and convenience of your home, office, or work! If there are schedule conflicts, a group project can be brainstormed before the meeting to ensure ideas are written/ typed up and members have actively contributed!

	<li>After clicking the share button, a window will pop up with sharing options. You can add emails of the people who you want to share it with. Change how they can access the document on the right (can edit, view, or comment). As the creator, you have the power!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Once re-named and shared, you can format, edit and insert within the doc. This acts similar to a Word doc.</li>
</ul>
### Commenting
![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/6-300x280.png)Comments are a great way of communicating with other contributors. Think of comments as being like sticky notes you would leave on a paper your helping to review. Ask for clarification or say you like what they put.

To comment on a sentence or paragraph, highlight/ select what you want to comment on. Then, type in your comment on the right side in the window that pops up. Hit “comment” (blue button) once done with your comment. The person who wrote it will then be sent a notification about your comment and can resolve it.
