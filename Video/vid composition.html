**Composition**
Composition is the placement or arrangement of visual elements or ingredients in a work of art, as distinct from the subject of a work. Where in the frame do you want to place the subject? What feeling do you want to convey to the viewer? “When you look at a scene with your naked eye, your brain quickly picks out subjects of interest. But the camera doesn’t discriminate – it captures everything in front of it, which can lead to a cluttered, messy picture with no clear focal point. What you need to do is, choose your subject… (and) camera viewpoint that makes it the center of attention in the frame. You can’t always keep other objects out of the picture, so try to keep them in the background or make them part of the story.”- [digitalcameraworld.com](digitalcameraworld.com)

**Rule of Thirds**
“The rule of thirds is a powerful compositional technique for making photos more interesting and dynamic. It's also perhaps one of the most well-known.”

**Lighting**
"The <i>Three Point Lighting Technique</i> is a standard method used in visual media such as video, film, still photography and computer-generated imagery. It is a simple but versatile system which forms the basis of most lighting. Once you understand three point lighting you are well on the way to understanding all lighting." -mediacollege.com
