<hr />

Here we are at the end of the quarter and the year. It's been a wild ride, but we think everyone has done amazing. Think back to fall quarter. Did you know what WordPress was? How to code? You can code now! How many of your friends can say that? No matter how little you think you understood, it's still more than most. You have the intellectual keys to understand things you never thought you could.

We're going to cap off the year with a final that's more practical and open and less objective that what you've grown accustomed to. We have contacted 5 NGOs who are in need of websites. They don't know much about computers, but they know that they need a web presence.

Your client will send you some information about what they do as well as general guidelines regarding what they want out of a website. It's your job to take their request and turn it into a working website. The directions they give you may seem vague, but that's one of the things you deal with when working with a client.
# Requirements
There are 5 NGOs and 17 of you. Prime numbers make group work awkward, so we'll have 3 groups of 3 and 2 groups of 4. Each group will choose an NGO with which to work.
### Division of Labor
How work is divided is up to your group, but everyone must put in the time. Part of your submission will be a private group member evaluation. If one person does all the work while one or both the others contribute nothing, we want to know so points can be adjusted accordingly.
### Hosting
One of you will need to create a new instance of WordPress on their domain (preferably as a <a href="https://www.cpanel.net/media/tutorials/subdomain.htm">subdomain</a>) to serve as the site you're creating. You must create unique users for each of the other members of the group (no one should use the same login). <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities">Here</a> is a page on user roles and capabilities.
### Theme
You may not use Twenty Twelve, Twenty Eleven, Graphene, or the _s (underscores) custom theme you made for the midterm. You must choose a theme from one of the roundups<strong> <a href="http://wplift.com/free-wordpress-responsive-themes-2013">here</a></strong>, or <strong><a href="http://psdblast.com/20-free-wordpress-themes-2013-responsive-wp-themes-for-designer ">here</a>.
</strong>
#### Child Theme and Custom Style
You will be asked to make some simple changes as part of the assignment, naturally you will need to create a child of whatever theme you chose to accomplish this. At a bare minimum, this would include the .css stylesheet, but if you were to alter other elements of the theme, be sure to create a child of it.
### SEO
Pages with actual content (so not the contact us, or calendar pages) need to get a green light or almost get a green light from WordPress SEO by Yoast. See the SEO lesson from Intro to Web Design if you're rusty.
### Maintenance
Set up your site with Broken Link Checker and BackupWordPress.

Ensure that your site is set up for regular backups of database content.

Install WP Help but don't write any help topics on their site. Instead, choose one group member to host the help topics on their own sites and use that instance of WP Help as the sync source. Include help topics for everything you feel is pertinent to this site. That means, if they don't have a blog, it would be inappropriate to include a help topic about tags and categories.

We will supply a sync source to a WP Help that has all the help topics that you guys created for HW 6. Copy the ones you want and put them in your own WP Help.

### Site Content
You don't need to write an epic novel for the site. Just fill in the site content as much as you can by making things up for your partner organization. This is a good place to exercise your writing skills.

Generally, all of them should have an About Us or Our Mission page containing their mission statement, as well as any site needs to include a Contact page. Most of them ask for specific plugins, widgets, APIs, embedded content, links to other sites and resources, those must be found by you.
# Our Partners
Here are the wonderful organizations that agreed to be your guinea pigs. They are an eclectic lot to say the least...

You should read their letters carefully and identify (**parse**) exactly what it is that they're asking.

# Edumacation Unlimited
#### Tagline: "Because our kids deserve gooder"
“Hi there, were Edumacation Unlimited. The kids are so distracted these days playing their Pokeeman vidya games that they don’t read much anymore. It doesn’t help that there schools don’t have a lotta books. We aim to give kids more opportunities to read. To do this, we combine the adventure of books with the ultra-coolness of electronics. We want to distribute ereaders to kids in low income areas, so that they can read a bunch. Right now we’re working in Santa Cruz county.

We want this site to be COOL, so we need lots of facebooks and twitters. I heard that you can have a facebooks box that shows up everything you post on your facebooks page. Same thing for twitters. I don’t care if it slows down the site, we need lots of facebooks and twitters.

It would be great if you could make a page that has a google map on it that as the locations of local libraries already on it. We can’t have them not coming to the library!

There are databases of free ebooks on sites like amazon, the gutenburg project, and free-ebooks.net. Can you make sure these links are displayed prominently?

We definitely need a page with our mission statement, and a page with how to contact us.

Could you make the site’s title be like, some kind of college-y font? also, a lot of us are UC alums so maybe there could be a blue/gold motif going on? (OR would that run into some sort of trademark issues?)

We want the front page to have a big picture of an e-reader (TXTR Beagle) and inside it be a picture of a little kid graduating.

Overall, our site needs to be both cool and smart! Just liek us!

# Name: Smogless Tots
#### Tagline: "10 million dead from slides is too much!"
Did you know that over 100,000 children die every year due to toxins found in playground equipment?! I’m not sure if that’s true, but it feels like it is. We are Smogless Tots and we work to reduce harm done to children due to dangerous and/or toxic playground equipment through advocacy and awareness.

Our site needs to reflect the dire state of affairs so we want the site to have all dark backgrounds and white text. If you can find a font that looks like super serious, or maybe like toxic ooze for the main title, that would be great

This site is basically going to be about sharing current toxic news and images we found and publishing angry diatribes about unsafe playground equipment. I guess they call that a blog. We don’t care about much else. Also, a map showing incidents in the local area would be really nice.

We just want people to see the pictures and share them across their social networks. Like, we want a button to automatically share the image with all their friends on whatever network they use.

# Name: Breaking Free
#### Tagline: "Escaping the yoke of injailment"
We are a local support group that works with recently paroled inmates to help give them life skills so that they don’t slip back into jailism. Recidivism is a major problem and we try and address it any way we can.

We want to make sure that they always know when we’re having meetings and where they are. Is there some way that there could be a page that is a large calendar with events and locations? Or maybe have a calendar on every page? Or both?

We want to make sure people can sign up for our weekly email newsletter through the site, we also need a newsletter system to do it.

Could you supply some links to things like life skill sites and resume builders?

We would like the front page of the site to have a large image on it that connotes freedom. We trust your judgement to find an appropriate image.

We're big fans of bold, impact fonts. Can you make it so the title of the site and any headings are in big, block lettering?

# Name: Delfin Hasta el Fin
#### Tagline: "Your dolphin until the end"
We provide counseling and legal services for undocumented parents of children who are US citizens. We draw inspiration from the noble dolphin. Dolphins have been known to guide shipwrecked sailors to safety and save divers from sharks. We like to think of ourselves as dolphins that guide our clients all the way through difficult times.

The tech literacy of our clients is sometimes extremely low. Like, some of them just learned to use a mouse. For that reason we want the website to be as simple as possible. We want it to be only one long page When you visit the site, we want the very first page they see to just be a choice between the spanish version of the site and the english version of the same site, and nothing else. Maybe the buttons can be flags.

A lot of people who use our site are elderly or visually impaired and need somewhat larger print. Could you make all the normal text be size 16 or so?

We need dolphin images everywhere of course, and a dolphin logo.

# Name: HomeMOREness
#### Tagline: "More homes. Less homelessness."
HomeMOREness is the insanely clever title of our organization. We run tech literacy classes for local homeless individuals. We have a weekly class at the Ultramat on Laurel. Homeless come in and get to use the laundry facilities for free in exchange for agreeing to work through the program. We teach email, and basic web use in order to find jobs and learn independently.

Since we use netbooks and weak wi-fi signals, we need a site that doesn’t take a long time to load. We want to have a facebook and twitter, because we want them to have a space to explore those things, but we don’t want them weighing down the site.

We want to encourage them to get in the habit of checking their email so we would like a mailing list service so that we can send them stuff often. We hear Mailchimp is good. Can we have a way for them to sign up right on the page?
