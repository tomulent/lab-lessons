# Project: Map of printers and Study Areas on UCSC Campus 
Last week in the mapping class we came to a consensus about what we’d like to see on a map of UCSC. One of the things many of the maps of the campus are missing is great study locations and the locations of printers around campus that students can use. Knowing where printers are for students to use could help save a good amount of time rather than having to go completely out of your way to find one. For the most part people study in the same spots on campus simply because they are the only ones they really know about, let’s change that. 

&nbsp;

Using Ushahidi we’re going to be doing an ongoing project for the rest of the quarter to map out these locations. Each student will be responsible for at least 1 submission per week of either a printer location or a place to study with a picture to go with it. Also you’ll add a bit of information on your submission for example if it’s in a hard to find spot give more information on how students can access it. Do they need to take stairs? Knock 3 times at the door in the shadows at the darkest depths of the library to find the mystery printer? Be specific. It’s only 1 a week. Check the map also, no copies. This is a map for all students and all your friends, so find good places you think are great spots to study. Don’t be afraid to ask around also in different colleges. If you don’t have a way to take a picture please talk to me.
