<div id="lesson">Softaculous is what's known as a "1-click Script Installer". It is a service that a host may pay for to allow their users to easily install software on to their sites like WordPress, Drupal, Moodle, MediaWiki, Magneto, or Simple Machine Forums. Many hosts will have something similar to softaculous, but it's always good to know how to [do it manually](http://labs.everettprogram.org/installing-wordpress-manually/) too!
## Installing WordPress
Installing WP (or any platform for that matter) is pretty simple. So follow the steps below.
### Step One: Obtain Your Login Info
Find the email from Lithium called "New Account Info". This contains the most important information about your website. In it will be some information like IP address of your server, temporary credentials, and so forth. Find the two items "Username" and "Password".

The password is changeable, but please do write it down. The username is a string of random letters and cannot be changed. Write this down to.
### Step Two: Login to Your Domain's Backend
The backend of your site contains a lot of management tools. Some of them you'll learn to use in this class, other's you might figure out on your own, and still others you will most likely never touch.

To login, go to "www.yoursite.com/cpanel" and then input your username and password

### Step Three: Open Up the Platform Installer
Scroll down to 'Softaculous' under the 'Software' tab. Softaculous is the easy-install program that comes with Lithium Domains. Later in the course, we'll show you what an awesome resource this can be.

### Step Four: Select WordPress
It's probably front and center, but you can also find it under "Blogs" over on the left hand menu. Either way, select it and hit "Install"

### Step Five: Input Correct Install Information
Most everything is as it should be and you don't need to worry about. Just a couple things need your attention.

If you want WordPress to be in your **root directory** (i.e. when you go to www.yoursite.com) then leave the "In Directory" field blank.

If you want this installation of WP to be in a different directory (www.yoursite.com/newdirectory), then specify the name in the "In Directory" field.

And then change the Admin Account Information to be a username and password that you'll remember. By default, the username will appear as 'admin' and the password will appear as 'pass'. It is utterly imperative that you enter secure login credentials now. If you leave them as 'admin' and 'pass', then a bot will come across your site and attempt to login using that combo. Whatever login credentials you choose, WRITE THEM DOWN
