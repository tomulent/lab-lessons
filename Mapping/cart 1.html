<h1><b>**What is mapping?**</b></h1>
[toggle title="Learn more..."]

Mapping is the act of organizing geographical based information and visually displaying the patterns and stories that the data tells on a map.

<h1><b>**What can maps be used for?**</b></h1>
[toggle title="See more..."]
<ul>
	<li>
<div>Participatory Mapping</div>
<ul>
	<li>The process of making a map and the map itself can be representative of diverse communities, voices, stories, and information.
<ul>
	<li>Example: Check out [HarrassMap.org](http://harassmap.org/en/who-we-are/how-and-why-we-began/)! The map was "born as a response to the persistent problem of sexual harassment on the streets of Egypt, to which society has become increasingly tolerant. It is the first independent initiative to work on the issue." The map serves as online reporting tool that supports an effort to break stereotypes, stop making excuses for perpetrators, and to convince people to speak out and act against harassment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Decision Making
<ul>
	<li>Because maps display information specific to location, hopefully with a more simplified visual representation, it may help political figures, activists, citizens, and community leaders make informed decisions.
<ul>
	<li>Example: Let us say that we have mapped out all of the fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in Watsonville in order to determine the degree of accessibility to healthy food. Our map might easily show that there is more access to unhealthy fast-food retailers in a certain concentrated area. This information might help the local government officials determine where to allocate their attention and resources to address the problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Sharing Critical Information
<ul>
	<li>One of the ultimate goals of making a map is to share the information displayed on it. More specifically, maps are meant to make this information more comprehendible and easily accessible to both the general public and key decision makers. This is important as this information may be critical, time-sensitive, and/or require immediate response.
<ul>
	<li>For example: [Ushahidi](http://ushahidi.com/) ([Swahili](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language) for "testimony" or "witness") in the aftermath of Kenya's disputed 2007 presidential election (see <a class="mw-redirect" title="2007–2008 Kenyan crisis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_Kenyan_crisis">2007–2008 Kenyan crisis</a>), collected eyewitness reports of violence reported by email and text message and placed them on a [Google Maps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps) map (now as a map hosting website, they offer Crowdmap as a tool for others to create their own participatory maps). Here, Ushahidi made both the process of making the map and the map. a sharing process as it required others to report the violence and then the information collected was publicly available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Documentation and Evaluating Impact
<ul>
	<li>The information recorded and displayed on maps can help with documenting change over time. This is very useful for evaluating negative or positive impact because you can compare information from different time periods to show improvement, trends, or regressions. Most often this objective is utilized to highlight your organization's social impact, a growing need in the area, or analyzing change.
<ul>
	<li>For example: If you are working with an at-risk youth program at a school, you can map out the 10 block radius around the school to show how there are less crime incidents as result of your program's work. You can use a tool like [Crime Reports](https://www.crimereports.com/), which maps crime reports by ZIP codes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Creating Impact
<ul>
	<li>Another ultimate goal of mapping is to create some type of impact in addition to simply visually sharing the information. You might think "well duh", but creating an impact is not always the goal for everyone. I have seen plenty maps demonstrating the tweet responses to Beyonce's album release. Creating an impact through mapping is a powerful basis for advocacy and transparency when are speaking about mapping for social justice.
<ul>
	<li>Example: In the case of Colombia, [a map was created ](https://www.newtactics.org/comment/2276#comment-2276)that combined data on the frequency of human rights violations caused by military officials with the locations of US government funding for military operations. The map portrayed the links between US military funding and local human rights violations in Colombia, and thus challenged the US government’s claim that the funding did not have any adverse effects in Colombia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>
<div><strong>**Showing Need- **</strong></div>
<ul>
	<li>If you have been a student of our Sociology 30 series, then you know how important it is to SHOW a need when writing a proposal. Maps are a great way to visually display this need.
<ul>
	<li>Example: Think about your proposal's need. How would you demonstrate it through a map? Remember you are trying to demonstrate the quantifiable link between your services and community need. You think a community needs computer literacy classes for adults? Make a map that demonstrates the accessibility of computers or internet in the area. Maybe you can make a map showing how many people are considered computer literate in the area by age. The ideas are endless as long as it supports your argument.</li>
</ul>

# Terms and Concepts
You will write these!
<!--
[toggle title="See more..."]

**Cartography:  **the science or practice of drawing maps.

&nbsp;

**Geography:**
Geo- “of or relating to the earth.”
Graphy- a descriptive science.

**Map: **Most simply, maps represent an area spatially and through non-spatial features. They are not only limited to displaying roads, streets, and features of locations but they may also display political boundaries, population, physical features, natural resources, economic resources, and much more! Whereas once they were mostly represented a on 2-d flat surface, now with countless of digital mapping tools available, you can view certain maps in 3-d.

**Geographic Information System (GIS) **is a computer-based tool that integrates multitude of databases allowing you the power to easily modify and analyze data in order to make informed decisions. Think about it as your an powerful organizing tool.

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/7223C234-8DB1-4BA7-BF9C-2083CE948F8F-300x277.png)Don’t get to bogged down in the definition of GIS. Think of it as a realm of science concerned with encoding data (drinking fountains, borders, traffic signals, chupacabra sightings) with spatial coordinates so that we can build rich, interactive, and infinitely configurable maps.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<div>**Geocoding: **The process** **of converting** **a place/address/or   other form of location reference and description to its corresponding** **latitude and longitudinal coordinates.</div>
### Types of Maps
There are many types of maps in existence such as topographic, political, physical, climate, and economic and resource allocation maps. Sometimes, maps may combine  some of their features on a map but nonetheless, each map is focused on showcasing one of these themes. Two types of maps that are central to our course are described below:

**Reference Maps:**

Reference maps give you the nitty-gritty about a place. They are designed to show only geographic features such as rivers and boundaries such as county district lines. Also may include information such as the names of roads or towns. Ever heard the term “political map”? That’s a map that’s just the political boundaries of a place. Like below is a political map of Africa:

**Thematic**:

Thematic maps are focused on showing data based on a theme. They are designed to tell a story using demographic, economic, business, or socioeconomic data. Most often they are the result of data that has been analyzed and thus, provide the end result. These maps may use features from reference-like maps  to support the data but the focus remains on the theme. Consider the map below:

This map shows the same *place* as the map above, but it is telling you something much deeper than just what the names and boundaries of nation states are.

**Layers**
Data sources that can be easily manipulated on the basemap. Each data source acts as a single and separate unit.
<ul>
	<li>Education level, Income, Age, etc.</li>
	<li>Roads, parcels, streets, etc. (as demonstrated in the GIS example)</li>
</ul>
**Markers**
A marker identifies a location on a map. By default, a marker ![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/maps-300x300.png)uses a standard image. Markers can display custom images, in which case they are usually referred to as “icons.”

**Basemap**
Background information that allows the viewer to know where they are. MapBox offers a range of readily available options before starting off your map:

# **Challenges and Lessons:**
[toggle title="See more..."]
<ul>
	<li>Publicly available maps that fit your needs are always great! However, with any information out there, make sure that the data sources are credible.</li>
	<li>Sometimes maps share a great deal of critical information about people, causes, location, etc. Therefore, we need to continually think about both our data and our audience as this information can land in the wrong hands. For example, you might have a map that allows reports from the general public. If there is identifiable information about the reporter or anyone else, they might be at risk for being captured.</li>
	<li>You might not always find all of the data that you need to create your map so you have to go the extra mile to gather that information on your own (i.e lat/lat coordinates, buildings, reports, statistics). For example, you might be looking to add information about a rural town in Mexico but there there aren't any maps that have the town's streets mapped out yet. You might have to go out there and get that information before adding anything else.</li>
