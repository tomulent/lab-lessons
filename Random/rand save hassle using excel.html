Sometimes it's hard to connect the more technical aspects of what you learn in lab. This is going to show you that the applications of any specific concept may not be immediately apparent, but they are there if you try.
<h2>How I  Saved A Lot of Time And Energy</h2>
When you signed up for the class we had you submit a writing sample, a survey, and a picture. It would be horrible to sort through if they were all in one folder so we wanted an individual folder for every person enrolled. There being upwards of 50 people, you can imagine how tedious that would be to create a folder for every single person.

To get a folder in the format "Last Name, First Name" You would have to:
<ol>
	<li>Create a new folder</li>
	<li>Look at the roll</li>
	<li>Type out the name</li>
	<li>Repeat</li>
</ol>
That doesn't sound like much, but do it 50 times and it's pretty annoying. Why can't we do it all at once?
<h1>The Terminal</h1>
Your computer uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to make it analogous to a physical desktop complete with folders and files and such. In the olden days, you would do everything via a "Command Line Interface" (CLI). That means instead of double clicking on a folder called "30 A Students" to open it, you would need to write a command into the computer to make it perform that action. We won't get into all the commands that there are to execute, but suffice it to say, anytime you do anything on the computer (moving files, creating folders, deleting things, etc.) the computer is executing a command.

Using a GUI is much faster and more intuitive for individual tasks, but what if you want to do the same thing over and over again, say, 50 times? Like make 50 folders?
<h2>A Comparison</h2>
Let's see what it looks like to make a folder using the GUI vs. the CLI
<h3>GUI</h3>
I start in a folder called "Example" and go to "File &gt; New Folder"

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3619" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/gui-1.png" alt="gui 1" width="633" height="305" />

I've got a new folder, so I click on the title and rename it "Last Name, First Name"

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3620" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/gui-2.png" alt="gui 2" width="466" height="100" />

The whole thing took about 10 seconds. That's not painful, but that's only because I had to do it once. What if I had to do that 50 times? Don't forget you have to shift your focus between the folder and the list of names and believe me this takes a long, long time.
<h3>CLI</h3>
I start by going to "Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal.app" and opening it up

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3622" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cli-01.png" alt="Cli 01" width="445" height="469" />

This opens up the Terminal, Mac OSX's default Command Line Interface

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3623" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cli-2.png" alt="cli 2" width="579" height="376" />

Working in the Terminal you need to be very specific. Using the GUI, you would just open up the folder "Example" and be "in" it. With Terminal, you need to tell it what folder it should be "in".

To do this, you just type "cd" then a space, and then drag the folder "Example" onto the terminal window. Doing so will automatically enter the correct path to the folder.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3624" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cli-3.png" alt="cli 3" width="568" height="273" />

Hit Return and you're now "in" the folder "Example".  The command "cd" means "Change Directory" and the path that you supply it tells it exactly where to go.

Now to make the folder, you would use the command

mkdir "Last Name, First Name"

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3625" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cli-4.png" alt="cli 4" width="455" height="222" />

As you can see, the name that we put in between quotes after the command "mkdir" creates a folder of that name.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3626" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cli-5.png" alt="cli 5" width="570" height="334" />
<h3>Which Was Faster?</h3>
Probably the first one.  But that's what it was built for. Doing something once. What if I want to make 4 folders? I would just type the command "mkdir" followed by the name of the folders I wanted to create, in double quotes, separated by spaces.

We now have the working knowledge to create 50 folders. We just need to manipulate the list we already have a bit to get it in this format.
<h1>Excel Functions</h1>
Naturally, our class roster comes to us as a spreadsheet so it's already in a format ripe for manipulation. Here's what it looks like (these are fake names of course)

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3627" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/names-1.png" alt="names 1" width="507" height="371" />

First name in column A, last name in column B. Remember, we want it in the format "Last Name, First Name". So we need to create a function that will do that.
<h2>Combine Values</h2>
We're going to make a function that will take the value from the cell in column B (last names), insert a comma and a space and then take the value from the cell in column A (first name). The simplest way to do that is with the following function,

=B2 &amp; ", " &amp; A2

The "&amp;" sign means "And". The comma and space in between double quotes means "text", that is, whatever text put between double quotes will show up as plain text. So, =B2 &amp; ", " &amp; A2  means, "take the value from cell B2 and a space followed by a comma, and the value of cell A2 and put them in that order in this cell.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3628" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/names-2.png" alt="names 2" width="421" height="71" />

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3629" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/names-3.png" alt="names 3" width="401" height="95" />

That's the format we want, for sure, but there's something else. Remember that we need to have each folder name in between double quotes. So we just need to update the function to put double quotes on either end. To do that you change the function to this,
<p class="p1">=CHAR(34) &amp; <span class="s1">B2</span> &amp; ", " &amp; <span class="s2">A2</span> &amp; CHAR(34)</p>
<p class="p1">You might ask, "What's with the CHAR(34) thing? You said anything in between double quotes will show up in the cell." Well, that's what I thought too. But apparently, Excel get's confused by this, so you need to CHAR(34) to represent a double quote character. Anyway, here's what it ends up looking like,</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3630" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/names-4.png" alt="names 4" width="636" height="178" /></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3631" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/names-5.png" alt="names 5" width="522" height="189" /></p>
<p class="p1">Sweet! We've got it how we need it! Now just grab the little square and drag down for the rest and we've got ourselves our formatted list.</p>

<h2 class="p1">One Last Bit of Formatting Left</h2>
We can't just paste this into the Terminal quite yet. Each name is on a different line, which Terminal will read as you actually hitting the return key and consequently will only make the first name and then give you a bunch of errors. So we need to clear the line breaks so that all the names are on one line and separated by a single space.
<h3>Paste the Column into Word as Unformatted Text</h3>
If you just do normal paste, it will be a table and we don't want that. Go to "Edit &gt; Paste Special..." and select "Unformatted Text". You'll be left with something like this:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3632" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/words-1.png" alt="words 1" width="418" height="221" />
<h3>Open the Find and Replace Pane</h3>
The thing that we need to find is called a "Carriage Return". If you've ever seen an old timey typewriter, they had this lever that you would push to scroll the paper up a line and bring it back to the starting position so you could keep writing.

[caption id="attachment_3633" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="wp-image-3633 size-full" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/typewriter3.jpg" alt="typewriter3" width="500" height="375" /> 7 is the carriage return lever[/caption]

Basically when you hit the "Return" key, the computer inserts an invisible character called a "Carriage Return". We need to find all of these and replace them with a "Space". That would ultimately put everything on the same line.

So how do you find them? Well you can't select them to copy paste into the find field, so we have to use a special character like we did to make the double quote a minute ago. Word has a little menu for special characters, but it's not very exhaustive, so I had to turn to Google to find it. The character code for Carriage Return in Word is

^13

Put that into the find field and just type a space into the replace field, hit Replace All and watch the magic happen.

Pretty cool, eh?
<h2>Back To Terminal</h2>
Now it's just a matter of pasting that into the terminal after typing the "mkdir" command

Hit return and let 'er rip.

<h1>What Have We Learned</h1>
Something very specific, no doubt. You may never actually use what we showed you here, but the important thing to understand is this: There is a faster way to stuff. It's just a matter of being brave and trying to find the solution.
