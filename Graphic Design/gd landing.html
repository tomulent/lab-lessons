<strong>Social Science 1 Room 135, PC side Thursdays 6:00PM to 7:45PM</strong>
In this lab you will learn how to use graphic design for social justice issues and NGOs. We will be using Adobe Photoshop and Indesign to teach you how to create logos, flyers, articles, newsletters, as well as open source ways to visually represent information. This class is especially exciting because of our intimate size and Everett Reunion event in May. In the lab, we will be creating the graphics for the event like name tags, flyers and posters. Adobe might be intimidating at first, but I am here to help guide you through any problems that might occur, feel free to contact me through email or office hours.

<div><b>Attendance</b></div>
<div>Your active participation in Everett labs is crucial not just for your own success, but for that of your fellow students. Labs move very quickly and there are a limited number of meetings. Consequently, we only allow for two unexcused absences. After that, each unexcused absence will result in a 10% penalty to your final lab grade, which is 25% of your grade in 30C. If you think you cannot make it to lab, please email your lab leader before hand to make arrangements so that you do not fall behind.</div>
Students are required to show up on time and remain in class for the entire duration of the allotted time. Collaboration and mutual support are critical to success in the program. Hence, if you finish your work early, please assist your classmates in understanding/completing their work.

<strong>Assignment Due Dates</strong>
All assignments, both homework and projects, are due by the class time the week after it was assigned unless otherwise indicated.

<strong>Classroom Expectations</strong>
Tech labs are an integral part of the Everett Program and should be taken with the same seriousness as any other class. The same goes for interaction with the lab leaders and facilitators. They have been delegated authority by the instructor of record and should be treated with the same respect afforded to any instructor. This includes academic integrity.

<strong>Academic Integrity</strong>
Cheating on exams and plagiarism are examples of violations in the realm of ethics and integrity. If you have any questions on what constitutes both good scholarship or the consequences of failing to work within campus expectations of honesty and professionalism, please view the available resources through the Division of Undergraduate Education (http://www.ue.ucsc.edu/ai_resources).

<strong>Students Needing Accommodation</strong>
If you qualify for classroom accommodations because of a disability, please submit your Accommodation Authorization Letter from the Disability Resource Center (DRC) to me as soon as possible, preferably within the first two weeks of the quarter. Contact DRC by phone at 831-459-2089 or by email at drc@ucsc.edu for more information.
