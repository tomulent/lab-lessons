Everyone has been doing a fantastic job writing new content for their respective lessons. The value that you guys add to the tech labs cannot be understated. In fact, you guys are creating so much new stuff, that the pages have become enormous beasts of learning. It's time we thought about ways to manage that.

Don't bother going back on old stuff and do this. Use it going forward in whatever way you deem appropriate.
<h1>Toggles and Accordions</h1>
This theme comes with some nifty jQuery UI widgets. The lesson headers have that nice side by side effect going thanks to the "Columns" widget. Toggles are a fancy widget that allow you to hide away content behind a heading, so that people can find the content they're looking for faster. Here's one right here!

[toggle title="I'm a Toggle"]

See how the content is hidden away?

[/toggle]

[toggle title="Bee-ver"]

I'm sure you can see the potential of this? This could be used to split a lesson into discrete sections. Students won't have to search through as long to find what they need. All you need is to add a couple lines of text to your lesson.
<h2>How To Use Them</h2>
Toggles are created using <strong>shortcodes</strong>. Shortcodes are kinda like HTML, but they can go in the visual editor. Here's a picture of what the toggle shortcode looks like:

It produces this

<h2>How Can I Implement This?</h2>
It's really as simple as wrapping up whatever you want to be in a collapsible in the shortcode tags. Just make sure, like with HTML, that you have a opening and a closing.
<h2>What's An Accordion?</h2>
Oh right, that. An accordion is a consecutive set of toggles without any content in between the toggles. Only one can be open at once. Observe:

<h3>Produces This</h3>
[accordian]

[toggle title="Toggle 1"]

Only one can be open at a time

[/toggle]

[toggle title="Toggle 2"]

I don't think they're that useful for our purposes

[/toggle]

[/accordian]
<h2>That's All There Is To It</h2>
Just wrap your toggles up in in the "accordian" short code and they'll act in tandem. You may notice that accordion is spelled wrong. The developers of this theme can't spell.
