<div id="lesson"><!--BEGIN LESSON--></div>
For your final project, we will be combining all of the tools and concepts you’ve learned in Photoshop and InDesign to make an awesome graphic for one of Everett’s partners, ETR (Education Training Research).  ETR has been conducting a longitudinal study and has brought data on different views of student confidence in math, barriers at home and in school, demographics on the individual and household, and resources. We have been asked to visualize the data through infographics. They will be using these infographics to show PVUSD administration, principals, and teachers to gain a better understanding of the students and their performance in math.  Using your skills in Photoshop and InDesign, you will have the chance to showcase your infographic work to the school district with ETR.

We will be breaking down the data into 4 categories:
<ol>
	<li>Demographics - Individual</li>
	<li>Demographics - Household</li>
	<li>Barriers - At Home &amp; In School</li>
	<li>Resources</li>
</ol>
<strong>Download the data <a href="https://everettprogram.box.com/s/e2oqnaos3dputy4g158hm5r09ck6noeh">here</a>.  Download the questions broken down by category <a href="https://everettprogram.box.com/s/ucltk4qjqxwy4u9m2jh11fvg65pvrn7e">here</a>.</strong>
