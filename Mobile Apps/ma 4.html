So we've got an app that's a little easier to navigate around. You'll notice that it was also easier to put a link back to home than it was to make a forward and backward link on each individual page. This lesson will be a short one and not so technical.

[How Does Theming Work?](http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/dist/demos/faq/how-does-theming-work.html)
# "I want it to look iPhone-y"
You'll notice that right now our header bar is black. You may like how that looks, but you should be able to make things look any way you want. Take a guess how you'll make the page elements (i.e. toolbars, buttons, text, etc) look different. If you said "with a data attribute, then you've been paying attention. Specifically, we'll be using the attribute ' data-theme="a-e" '. Let's do an example of how to quickly change the theme of a header bar.
## Use That jQuery Magic
Here's what my app's homepage looks like right now

Now we add  **data-theme="b" **to the header of my homepage. b refers to a particular color scheme. You can set the value to any letter between a and e.

Now look at it.

That was easy wasn't it?

## All Together Now
You'll notice that we only changed the theme of that one header bar. We want to change how they all look. I'm trying hard to find a way to have the default theme be "b" instead of "a", but for now, we'll need a work around. We have two options:
<ol>
	<li>Manually add **data-theme="b" **to every header in our app</li>
	<li>Write it once and have it do the work for us.</li>
</ol>
The credo of every coder is "Don't Repeat Yourself" so we'll be going with option 2. How do we do that? A simple find and replace in our text editor should do it.
## Find and Replace
In case you haven't encountered this term before, it refers to a function of text editors and word processors that will find all the occurrences of a string (that's computer talk for "sequence of characters to be treated as text") and replace it with another string.

Say you had written a poem for someone in the past. But now you don't like that person anymore and want to give the poem to a new person. You can quickly tailor it to the new person by doing a find and replace that will find all the instances of the name of your old squeeze and replace them with the name of the new one.

In the equally tumultuous world of coding, we're going to use the same principle to save us some work. Open up the Find window of your text editor. I use TextWrangler so I hit "command + F". If you're using Notepad ++ it's probably "ctrl + F". I start by telling it what string I want find and then telling it what I want to replace it with.



Everywhere that &lt;div data-role="header"&gt; showed up on my page, there will now be &lt;div data-role="header" data-theme="b"&gt;

# Project
Super easy. Use find and replace to change the theme of your headers.
