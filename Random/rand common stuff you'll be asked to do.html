These tech labs often require you to submit homework in ways that you may not be used to. It's important that you be able to do certain tasks, so we made this post for you to use as a reference.
# Taking Screenshots
This is a common task. A lot of times a homework assignment will call for you to prove that you did something in the back end of a website or on your computer and the best way of doing this is with a screenshot. Here are the various methods for accomplishing this.
## Cross Platform - Skitch
We highly recommend using the 3rd party application, <a href="https://evernote.com/skitch/" target="_blank">Skitch</a> by Evernote. Skitch is lightweight, easy to use, and offers simple methods of annotation.

The best way to understand how a new tool works is to do two things:
<ol>
	<li>Install and play with it</li>
	<li>Read the documentation.</li>
</ol>
We'll use the word, "documentation" a lot in this lab. Documentation refers to all the manuals, tutorials, videos, and supporting documents that go along with any given software. Successful apps understand how important their documentation is, so they invest in making it as good as possible. Skitch has simple yet comprehensive documentation for all platforms.

## Where Do Skitch Screenshots Go?
This is one thing that Skitch doesn't do so well is tell you where the image files are. From a technical standpoint, they're located inside the application itself in a place you're not supposed to go. To get them for Skitch onto your desktop so that you can send them to us, you just need to drag them there. Either from the annotation window or the screenshot manager.

## Mac
Apple computers have an easy, built-in screenshot tool that are already bound to your keyboard and will work in any application. Here are the controls:
<ul>
	<li>⌘ + Shift + 3: Takes a screenshot of the screen, and saves it as a file on the desktop</li>
	<li>⌘ + Shift + 4: Then select an area: Takes a screenshot of an area and saves it as a file on the desktop</li>
</ul>
To change the keyboard shortcuts, go to "**System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts**"  and then select "Screen Shots" from the left sidebar.

By default, screenshots save directly to your desktop. If you want the screenshot images to save in a location other than the desktop, check out <a href="http://www.maclife.com/article/columns/terminal_101_changing_screenshot_capture_location" target="_blank">this guide</a>.

There are lots of neat tricks you can do with the native screen capture in OS X. Check out <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/take-screenshots-mac-tips-tools/" target="_blank">this pos</a>t to learn them.
### Annotating Screenshots on Mac
The default image and document viewer for Mac is called "Preview". It opens a wide range of files from PDF to TIFF and has some basic annotation tools. For a good rundown of what Preview can do for annotation, check out the official documentation from Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201740" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH20218?locale=en_US" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you’re not comfortable with manually taking a screenshot and pasting it into an application for editing and/or saving or if you often take partial screenshots and want to save time cropping the image, you should try the Windows 7 Snipping Tool. You can find it under &gt; *Start* &gt; *All Programs* &gt; *Accessories* &gt; *Snipping Tool*.

<img class="aligncenter" title="How To Take Awesome Screenshots In Windows 7   image" src="http://cdn.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/PrintScreen02.png?a53b57" alt="PrintScreen02   How To Take Awesome Screenshots In Windows 7" border="0" />
<div class="img__sharer"></div>
You can select from taking a free-form Snip, a rectangular Snip, a Windows Snip (same as [ALT] + [PrtScrn]), or a Full-screen Snip (same as just [PrtScrn]). The partial screenshot is pretty neat and something you cannot easily do with the manual method described above.

<div class="img__sharer"></div>
When you’re done taking your screenshot, the image is opened in the Snipping Tool editing window. Here you can draw with a pen, highlight elements, copy the image for further editing elsewhere, or save it.

<div class="img__sharer"></div>
You can do all that and more with IrfanView and other tools. For simple screenshots in Windows, however, you may find it more comfortable to work with the Snipping Tool.

1. **Set up the screen** as whatever you want to take a screenshot of.

2.** Hold down the Windows Key and Print Screen**.

3. You’ll find a **new screenshot in the Pictures folder in your Library**.

## Chrome OS
To take a shot of the whole screen press the ‘Ctrl’ + ‘Window Switcher’ keys at the same time.

# Compressing (Zipping) Files
You will often be asked to "compress" or "archive" or "**zip**" a folder before submitting it. These terms all refer to the same action, which is to create an archive file. Basically, it's a means of combining several files and folders into a single file that's easier to send to someone else. Sometimes a homework assignment will require you to submit multiple files. By putting them all into a folder and **zipping** it up, you can submit a single file rather than uploading them all one by one.
## Mac
Put all the desired files into a folder and give it a name. Right-click (control-click) on the folder and choose  <code>Compress "[file name]"</code>

## Windows
Right-click on the folder you want to zip and select Send To &gt; Compressed (zipped) Folder.

# Submitting Work in the Correct Format
One of the biggest issues students have is with submitting their work in unreadable formats. This is obviously a problem because we can't read what's you're giving us. Here are the most common conversions you may need to do.
## Converting Pages to Word Format
If you have a Mac and use Pages.app as your word processing app, please understand that no one can open the files you send them. Files created in Pages.app are saved with the .pages extension. These files can *only* be opened if you have Pages.app, which most people do not. **If you submit work in .pages format, it will count as not having been submitted and will be marked off (this applies to the Tuesday class as well). **If you must use Pages.app, then you need to know how to save in a format that's actually useful.

Luckily it's easy to do. Go to the **File &gt; Save As **and then check the box to save a copy as Word Document. Make sure you select the .docx format since it's the newest and most portable version.
## When You Use Google Docs
Google Docs is a great zero-cost, simple, cloud based word processor, but we find a lot of people don't know how to share their work.
### Don't
Upload a Google Doc from your Drive. The files in your Google Drive are actually document files. They're just references to a location in your Drive. They can't be opened by anyone but you.
### Don't
Send us the URL for your Doc. For one, nobody who does this ever remembers to allow others to view the doc so we can't see it. Secondly, when you submit an assignment, it is what you did up to the deadline. By sending us a URL to your live, working document, you're not submitting a complete, polished assignment.
### Do
Download it as a Word Document or PDF. It's easy. In the Doc, just go to "**File &gt; Download as**"
