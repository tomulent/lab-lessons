# Password Creation on Social Media
[toggle title= "Strong Passwords"]
<div>This is so important that we are mentioning it once again. If you have already created a template for strong passwords that ensure you'll be safe and will remember them feel free to move right along.</div>
<div>**If not**, make sure to read through this:</div>
<div>A strong password should be used for any account you make even if are going to delete it after a short while!</div>

<div>*So here at the Everett Programs tips:*</div>
<ul>
	<li>use upper case letter(s)</li>
	<li>use lower case letter(s)</li>
	<li>use number(s)</li>
	<li>use symbol(s)</li>
	<li>use atleast 8 characters</li>
	<li>does NOT contain your user name, real name, or company name</li>
	<li>does NOT contain a complete password</li>
</ul>
<div>

<div>I know this is hard to make different passwords each times.  It takes a ton of brain power.</div>

<div>*Here is a **tip** on how to differentiate a strong base password:*</div>

<div>If your strong password is: joe500MPH, then for each account you have or will make do the following--&gt; joe500MPH-amazon, joe500MPH-venmo, etc or joe500MPH:amazon, joe500MPH:venmo.</div>
<ul>
	<li>  The general format is use the base strong password place in a punctuation</li>
</ul>

## The Do's of Twitter
**You only have 140 characters per tweet, to maximize that you should optimize each character by:**
<ul>
	<li>Using buzz and key words in posts.</li>
	<li>Try to keep the post characters between 70 to 100... it hits the sweet spot for most twitter followers as it allows them to retweet while adding their own comment.</li>
	<li>Use a link shortening service such as [bitly](https://bitly.com/). Simply copy and paste the URL you want to tweet (or post, or email or etc...) in the window, and it will automatically be shrunk but equally functional.</li>
	<li>Only using hashtags that are relevant to what you are discussing.</li>
	<li>Adding your own original comment when tweeting news.</li>
	<li>Tweet your likes and dislikes:
<ul>
	<li>State what you did or didn't like about an article in the retweet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Use [Twazzup](http://www.twazzup.com/)!
<ul>
	<li>Twassup is more than just a real-time search tool for Twitter. It provides real-time updates displaying specific keywords, the top or trending tweets and a list of top tweeted stories on a certain topic.</li>
	<li>Twazzup also shows a list of the most authoritative Twitter users. This is a great benefit to other users of this online tool as it enables them to find and follow valuable users. To use this app, simply enter a Twitter handle, keyword or hashtag and you will then be provided with related keywords, trending information and real-time tweets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Monitor hashtag (via twazzup) and see what you could tweet to help them!
<ul>
	<li>Use continual hashtags to be consistent for your followers</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Connect people via twitter.</li>
	<li>Create an engaging conversation with your followers.
<ul>
	<li>Ask questions to your followers, listen, and retweet to keep the conversation going.</li>
	<li>What are you doing that will inform and/or engage your followers?</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Use the correct tone and words for the audience you are trying to attract, but make it conversational so your personality shows.
<ul>
	<li>For example I would tweet: "Joseph E. Stiglitz on <a class="twitter-hashtag pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ebola?src=hash" data-query-source="hashtag_click"><s>#</s>**ebola**</a> and the layers of <a class="twitter-hashtag pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/inequality?src=hash" data-query-source="hashtag_click"><s>#</s>**inequality**</a> it exemplifies <a class="twitter-timeline-link" dir="ltr" title="http://bit.ly/1yBAQHv" href="http://t.co/EXR6djbWwi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-expanded-url="http://bit.ly/1yBAQHv">http://bit.ly/1yBAQHv </a>"</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Be as creative as you can with the post, hashtags, and images.</li>
	<li>Setup alerts relevant to your interests using tools like Google Alerts, Hootsuite (free to an extent), Buffer (free to an extent), or other social media softwares.</li>
</ul>

# Facebook Pages
[accordian]

[toggle title="The Why's and What's of Facebook Pages"]
## Why Are They Important?
Facebook pages are important because you can post pictures, quotes, information, and more all while connecting with your audience! You can add people to your Facebook network to continue to update and connect with them! More so, they can have your information actively displayed on your page. Then, they can share your page with others!
## **What Do They Do?**
Facebook pages are useful to keep track of statistics (how many people visited your site each day), see how many likes you received, and figure out the type of audience you or your organization has! Pages are a great way to manage and connect various forms of social media in a simple and effective way! Simply link posts to other forms of social media to increase views, followers, and likes!
## Why Nonprofits and For-profits Use It as a Tool
Organizations use Facebook pages as a tool because they are proven effective in managing social networks and also allow a wide range of people to stay connected to in a semi-professional way. Although there are more professional sites for individuals, like Linked In, almost everyone has a Facebook (think of your parents and grandparents!) It's pretty easy to use and navigate, as well as spread the word about your latest event or accomplishment! Keeping people is easy, as you can post something every day to ensure people are keeping your organization in their mind and on their map!
## Pages vs. Profiles
Many students' first foray into creating an online identity for an org or cause is to "make a Facebook for it". It's important to understand what exactly we mean when we say that. It's all about the difference between a Facebook **page** and a Facebook **profile**.
### Facebook Profile
Facebook is comprised of individual human beings. A human goes to Facebook.com, signs up for an account using a human name, and then adds information to their **profile**. This human, through their profile, makes status updates, posts images, builds photo albums, etc. I hope the repetition of the word "human" makes clear the main point here. Profiles are for real actual people who were born, breath air, and consume nutrients. Everything else gets a **Page**.
### Facebook Page
A Facebook Page is for things like businesses, orgs, causes, abstract concepts, and other things that are explicitly not a human being. A page is a lot like a profile, but it is different in some key ways. Here's what Facebook has to say about that:
<blockquote>
Personal profiles are for non-commercial use and represent individual people. You can [follow](https://www.facebook.com/help/276458109035418) profiles to see public updates from people you're interested in but aren't friends with. Pages look similar to personal profiles, but they offer unique tools for businesses, brands and organizations. Pages are managed by people who have personal profiles. You can [like](https://www.facebook.com/help/216630288356463) a Page to see updates in News Feed.
Keep in mind that each person who signs up for Facebook has one account with login information. Each account can have one personal profile and manage multiple Pages.

If you're part of a social media team, then you're going to want multiple people to be able to manage a page. This is easy to set up. Simply go to the page, go to "Settings &gt; Roles" and then add the person you want.

# RSS: Really Simple Syndication
[toggle title="RSS"]
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/C0z17UCW8ug" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
RSS is a simplified way of getting your 'news'. When we're talking about 'news' in this context, we mean things like:
<ul>
	<li>Blog Posts</li>
	<li>Twitter Feeds</li>
	<li>Craigslist Postings</li>
	<li>News Articles</li>
</ul>
You probably have a dozen or so websites that you get news and frequently updating content from. After a certain number of sites, it gets very impractical to check each one of them individually. RSS is a way of having all these things come to a single place for you to see and manage all at once.
![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/feedly-logo11-300x139.jpg)
We're big fans of [Feedly](http://feedly.com), so go ahead and create yourself an account. Their signup system is somewhat odd in that you sign up using some other service like Facebook, Twitter, or Google.
Once you're there start adding feeds! Watch the screencast to see the full process in action. Or don't, it's pretty easy to use. Just paste a URL into the search bar and it will find the feed address associated with it. Watch the screencast above for more on using Feedly.

# Social Media Managers
This refers to tools, not people, although sometimes people are tools. A social media manager is a service that allows you to access all the functionality of multiple social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Google+, ect.) from a single place as opposed to visiting multiple sites. We're going to take you through the free versions of two of the dominant ones because they're free and quite easy to use.
<h2>[Hootsuite](http://signup.hootsuite.com/pro-ent-na-english-r8/?&amp;mkwid=sDAsRitua_dc&amp;pcrid=44690206414&amp;pkw=hootsuite&amp;pmt=e&amp;cntry=na-usa&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=hootsuite_pro_google_search_usa_english_branded_alpha&amp;gclid=CL3704_E18gCFcNcfgodJFIEWg)</h2>

Rather than writing out step by step how to use it or subjecting you to another one of Thomas's screencasts, we've embedded the first series of their excellent tutorial videos. Each is only a couple minutes long and concicely explains how to get started, the terminology they use, and why you would want to use these tools.

## Advanced Hootery
[accordian]

[toggle title="How To Schedule Posts Ahead Of Time"]
### Pre-Scheduling Tweets and Posts
Probably the most useful thing these managers allow you to do is the ability schedule posts ahead of time. You can write the content, set a time, and walk away. In this way, you can preload up a week's worth of tweets or Facebook posts! That's what we call automating!

[/toggle]

[/accordian]
<h2>[Buffer](http://bufferapp.com)</h2>
[toggle title="Buffer"]

Buffer is very similar to Hootsuite, but has a much simpler interface. It's really up to you to decide which one you like best.

The idea behind Buffer is that you create a schedule of predetermined times that you want to tweet at; you then load up a queue, or "buffer". You can load it straight from the website, using the buffer extension, or using a CSV. A CSV is a comma separated values file, which allows data to be saved in a table structured format (more on that later).
<blockquote>
**Buffer**: In computing buffer, also called buffer memory, is a portion of a computer's memory that is set aside as a temporary holding place for data that is being sent to or received from an external device, such as a hard disk drive (HDD), keyboard or printer.
</blockquote>
### Make An Account, Add a Social Media Account, Get Posting
At this point you are all masters of signing up for new services, so we won't bother explaining the obvious. You will also need to link up your desired social media accounts. This is very straightforward.

Buffer allows you to be precise down to the minute about when you want your posts to go out. Hootsuite requires you to schedule in 5 minute intervals. Go ahead and click on the "Schedule" tab and choose a couple of time slots

## Loading the Buffer
[toggle title="Through The Web App"]

Let's say I found myself an article like [this one](https://www.thetoolbox.org/articles/871-three-tech-tools-skills-for-social-impact-education#.VimcyBCrQY0). I would just go to my buffer dashboard, write a title, paste the link (The link will automatically be shortened for you) and hit "Add to Queue". After you do that, you can view your

As you can see on the little time stamp in the bottom left corner that it is set to go out at 3:25 PM, which was the time slot that we set earlier.

Browser extensions are little modifications that add functionality to your web experience. In the case of Buffer, the extension will allow you to add things to your Buffer without having to go to bufferapp.com

Anyway, go to [bufferapp.com/extras](https://bufferapp.com/extras) and click the link to download the buffer extension for your particular browser. Once you do, you're ready to add things to your Buffer!

[toggle title="Using Bulk Buffer"]

Bulk Buffer is a 3rd party website that ties into your buffer. It allows you to upload a file containing multiple tweets. Some people prefer to compose tweets outside of the webapp. It allows you more control of things. Plus, it's an easy way of reusing old tweets.
### Creating a CSV File
CSV is a type of document meaning, Comma Separated Values. It's a very compatible format and a lot of large sets of data are often exported in CSV format. There are two ways of editing them:
<ol>
	<li>Using spreadsheet software like Excel or Google Sheets, and</li>
	<li>A text editor like Notepad++, TextWrangler, or TextEdit.</li>
</ol>
If you're on a Mac download [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/). If you're using Windows, download [Notepad++](http://www.notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.6.9.html). Create a new file and save it as "Tweets.csv". That's all it takes really. Once you've done that it's just a matter of writing your tweets into it. One per line.
