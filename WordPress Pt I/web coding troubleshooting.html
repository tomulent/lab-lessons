Hi everyone,

I've been getting a lot of questions about code not displaying right. 9/10 the problem is with one of the following things. So without further adieu, here is the solution to must coding issues!
<div>Image Not Showing</div>
<div>
<ol>
	<li>Check your syntax
<ul>
	<li>It should be  &lt;img src="address" /&gt; where "address" is a URL or the name of an image file</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Make sure the image file is in the right place
<ul>
	<li>Any file you reference must have a clear path to it. This means if you write &lt;img src="logo.png" /&gt; then logo.png must be in the same folder as your webpage. If it's in a folder called "images" then you need to say so  like, &lt;img src="images/logo.png" /&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
Style Not Showing Up

</div>
<div>
<ol>
	<li>Check that you have referenced your stylesheet correctly and that it's in the same folder as your webpage
<ul>
	<li>Put this code inside the head: &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" /&gt; The head, as you recall, is the place to define information about a page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Make sure you're using the correct syntax for CSS. It looks like this:
<ul>
	<li><img alt="Inline image 1" src="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&amp;ik=90938702ba&amp;view=att&amp;th=13cd0f1d31d727d2&amp;attid=0.2&amp;disp=emb&amp;realattid=ii_13cd047be62c4f0e&amp;zw&amp;atsh=1" /></li>
	<li>Notice the colons and semi-colons. The basic syntax is selector {property: value; property:value;}</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Make sure the property you're trying to use exists.
<ol>
	<li>Do a google search of the property you're trying to use. Make sure it's the right one</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
My HTML Elements aren't Showing Up or Are Showing Up Wrong

</div>
<div>
<ol>
	<li>Make sure you're using the correct syntax. A basic page looks like this:
<ul>
	<li><img alt="Inline image 3" src="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&amp;ik=90938702ba&amp;view=att&amp;th=13cd0f1d31d727d2&amp;attid=0.3&amp;disp=emb&amp;realattid=ii_13cd050b17d404c2&amp;zw&amp;atsh=1" /></li>
	<li>Note that all opening tags have an accompanying closing tag. &lt;p&gt; is paired with &lt;/p&gt;. &lt;body&gt; is paired with &lt;/body&gt;
<ul>
	<li>Exceptions to this rule are &lt;img&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; and &lt;link&gt;. This is because there is nothing that would ever go in between them, i.e. they stand alone</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Make sure you're not jamming block-level elements into each other.
<ul>
	<li>You'll recall that block-level elements (&lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, etc.) take up a whole "block" of the page. That is, they stretch the width of the page. They are meant to stand alone, so don't put them inside each other.</li>
	<li><img alt="Inline image 4" src="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&amp;ik=90938702ba&amp;view=att&amp;th=13cd0f1d31d727d2&amp;attid=0.1&amp;disp=emb&amp;realattid=ii_13cd0eb6a35415ef&amp;zw&amp;atsh=1" />
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
