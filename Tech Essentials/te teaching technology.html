# Introduction
There is a thing that happens in organizations when technical skills are involved: it’s easy for some people to lord their knowledge over others and use it as a tool to gain power over others. If you’ve ever been to a mechanic, you may have encountered this. People with technical knowledge have an advantage over those who do not. This can cause a lot of problems in a non-profit.

## Why This Lesson Could Apply to You
Have you guys ever been in an instance when you needed to help a friend with a computer problem? Or maybe you needed to teach some sort of technology for a job or project?

Well if that instance has ever occurred or might occur, then when you are writing the lesson plan somethings need to be considered.

You wouldn't want to be seen like the tech guy in the SNL skit, right?

# Example of a Perfect Lesson
[toggle title="Example of a perfect lesson"]

I found this a while back and was amazed at its simple brilliance: it's a video explaining how a differential gear works.

Just watch and we’ll discuss why this is such a great video and what you can learn from it (other than how a differential gear works)!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2m3b4l0IIY

&nbsp;
## Why This is an Awesome Lesson
The film starts by giving you several examples that demonstrate how two wheels spin at different speeds and why that’s important. It then shows us the apparatus and begins working through how to solve the problem.

At no point does the film ever assume that the viewer knows something. Every bit of information that is required to understand what’s going on is supplied as it becomes important. This is an ethic worthy of emulation.

# How to....
[toggle title="Choose tech tool(s)"]

Someone has approached you to solve a problem, since you are THE expert on tech, and you decide that technology is the best solution for the problem. Once you have reached this point, you can choose the tech tool(s) that you think fits best!
## Choosing tech tool(s)
Say someone wants to know what a good note taking app is. Well exercise your Google-Fu and start with a search. I searched for "best note taking tools" and immediately got a list from Lifehacker called Five <a href="http://lifehacker.com/399556/five-best-note-taking-tools">Best Note-Taking Tools</a>. Also I found <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/ask-the-entrepreneurs-9-best-note-taking-tools.html" target="_blank">Ask the Entrepreneurs: 9 Best Note Taking Tools</a>. I also went to Appstorm.net and searched for note taking apps and found a bunch more

Some of the ones that came highly recommended were
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.onenote.com/" target="_blank">OneNote from Microsoft</a></li>
	<li>Pencil and Paper (not an app lol)</li>
	<li><a href="http://simplenote.com/" target="_blank">Simplenote</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://notational.net/" target="_blank">Notational Velocity</a></li>
</ul>
That's really the secret to finding new tech. You ask around, either robots or humans, and then test out the apps. Download and play around for 20 minutes or so and see what you like. If something seems immediately intuitive and has good documentation, you've found yourself a good app. Congratulations!
## Alternate Method
Ask one of the Everett Fellows! They love talking tech and they absolutely love helping out students. Don't be shy!

[toggle title="Questions to answer when your tech tool is chosen"]
## Question to Answer When You Have Chosen Your Tech Tool
Whenever you are going to teach someone something you need to ask yourself some questions:
<ul>
	<li>
#### What do your pupils know?
</li>
	<li>
#### What am I trying to teach?
</li>
	<li>
#### What are the exact things in between what they know and what I want to teach?
</li>
</ul>
You need to ask yourself these questions **all the time.**
If you don’t, then you are **making an assumption** about your subject and if your assumption is wrong, **it may make a lesson useless.**

# Preparing a lesson
[toggle title="Case Study"]
# Companion Post
This section of the lesson deals with what went into writing the post found <a href="http://wp.me/p6RUeI-16c">here</a>. It deals with the app called Alfred. Have it open in another window so you can reference it.
# Setting Goals
Before you start writing, you need to plan what you're going to say. Start by listing out the goals of the lesson you're writing. That is to say, what do you want your readers to be able to do at the end of it? What is the most important stuff for them to know to get up and running? Here are the goals for the Alfred lesson:
<ol>
	<li>Understand what Alfred is</li>
	<li>Understand why they should use Alfred</li>
	<li>Have the settings configured for optimal use</li>
	<li>Understand how to search for files</li>
	<li>Understand how to use web search</li>
	<li>Understand how to create custom web searches</li>
	<li>Provide Alternatives</li>
</ol>
These goals are the guiding ideas behind the post. If I write a whole lesson on this tech tool and at the end can look down this list and say, "Yes. All that stuff happened", then I've made a good lesson.

Goals can be checked to get you back on track when you lose your way. Always begin a lesson -any project really- by listing your goals.

With these goals in mind, we can get to writing.
## Explain What It Is
Very first thing you do should be to summarize what a tool/app does. Is it a productivity tool? Does it manage your email? This doesn't need to be long. Feel free to steal from the app's website. Do this and Goal 1 is taken care of.
## Explain Why They Should Care
Look at the lesson to see the description of <a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/alfred-be-a-wizard-with-your-keyboard/#why-is-this-useful">why this is a useful thing to know</a>. Realize, that we write these at the beginning of each lab lesson...
## Deciding Where To Start
Always examine your assumptions, because when you assume you make an ass out of u and me. Where you decide to start a tutorial relies on some assumptions about the need for your audience to be directed. We can all assume that the user doesn't need to be told to turn on their computer or to continue breathing throughout the lesson.

Do they need to be walked through how to install the app? Unless there are special steps, I would argue that they don't. All that explaining how to install your run-of-the-mill app would accomplish is to expand the size of the lesson and make it more jumbled. For Alfred, all anyone needs is to be directed to where they can find the download link. The actual lesson can then begin with the assumption that they've installed the app and are eager to know how to use it.

For that reason, the lesson only contains a short line about <a href="http://labs.everettprogram.org/alfred-be-a-wizard-with-your-keyboard/#installing-alfred">intalling Alfred</a>.

Notice that I didn't include this as a goal. It's something that you can't really do anything without, so why include it. Same reason we didn't start with telling them to turn on their computer.
# The Lesson Proper
## Part I: Getting Set Up
Now that they've got it installed, what's the first thing to have them do? Well it depends on what you're teaching. I think a good rule of thumb is to begin with essential settings before diving into nifty functionality. If you were explaining Skitch, an essential setting would be to link it to your Evernote account. If you were writing a tutorial on Cyberduck, an FTP client, you would begin by having them configure the settings which allowed the proper text editor to be used.

The question to ask yourself is, "What do they need to know to get this thing working correctly so that all the functions will...function the way I want them too." If you're teaching a tool that you use, look at the settings you use and think back on why you put them that way.

So what are the essential settings? Well you need to be able to access Alfred quickly, and you need to make sure that it's searching for the right stuff on your computer. I'll then write a new section called "Getting Set Up" and put three sub sections within it called "**Changing the Hotkey**", "**Setting Search Scope**", and "**Setting File Types**"

Oh look, I've satisfied Goal 3.
## Part II: The Lesson
### What To Put In
Decide what features and how many of them you want to teach. Some things to consider when choosing:
#### Don't Go Overboard
Unless an app is super simple, you're not going to be able to hit all the features. That's what their documentation is for. You're writing this because somebody trusts you and will listen to this tiny training that you're giving them. You're going to get them up and running and past the starting out hump.
#### How representative of the tool is it?
You wouldn't tell someone about the Etherpad and then spend the whole lesson telling them how to use formatting would you? You're here to sell the user on an app, so try and go for something that really showcases what it does.
#### Understand the prerequisites
More complex apps will have functions built on functions. Let's say you were writing a tutorial on Evernote. If you wanted to write about making notebook stacks, you would first need to explain what a notebook was. For that matter, you'd need to explain what a note was! Systems are built upon systems.

Following in that same vein, make sure that your lesson is written in the correct order.
### What Went In
Having asked myself these questions, I decided that the features to include would be **File Search** and **Web Search**. Why?
<ul>
	<li>I felt two was a manageable number of features to throw at the user. There are way more, but are technical and only make sense once you're comfortable with the app</li>
	<li>They capture what Alfred is about: "Using the keyboard to do things fast rather than slogging through the GUI". The user can extract a great amount of value just from these things</li>
	<li>They don't require any specialized knowledge aside from what we configured in the settings section</li>
</ul>
Having wisely chosen and written them up, I satisfied Goals 4 through 6.
# Part III: The Wrap Up
## Summarize
Self-explanatory.
## Providing Alternatives
There is a wonderful site called <a href="http://alternativeto.net/">alternativeTo</a> which catalogues all the apps that are like other apps but are free. I highly recommend checking it out to find free alternatives to paid apps. I supply a link to the page cataloguing alternatives to Alfred and with that I've completed Goal 7 and can sit back.

[toggle title="Making Tech Homework"]

Homework is tough sometimes. You need to balance out the need for creativity with the need for objective outcomes and guidelines. It's a fine line and no one get's it 100% right but you can get close.
## Refer Back to What You Taught
Think back to the Alfred tutorial. What did it teach? Well according to the goals, they learned how to search their computer, search the web, and create custom searches. Why not start there?
### Searching for Files
You could have them do this, but you have to think about how you can actually make that into a task. Telling someone to "search some files" isn't the most challenging thing and it's hard to ask for proof that they did it. So if I were making an assignment, I wouldn't include this.
### Setting the Search Scope
Now that's something they could do. As the tutorial state, this is a crucial thing so it's totally useful to assign them to set the search scope to particular folders. Let's say, Applications and documents. As proof, they can -and I know you know what's coming- take a screenshot!
### Web Searches
This one is a no brainer. This is one of the things they learned to do, so it's only logical to ask them to create some custom searches. Assign 3 websites for which to make searches. You can ask that they prove this by taking a screenshot of the completed custom search query box and supply the search URL. That's them putting the lesson to use and the search URL itself can be shared with others!
## Limitations
I believe that's the end of the obvious functionality of the free version of Alfred. The full version is about $35 for 2 licenses. More than worth it to me, but not fair to expect students to pay. So how can we extend the assignment? The answer comes in the end of the tutorial when we linked free alternatives to Alfred.
### Students Can Add Value to a Course
Require students to download one of the free alternatives, play around with it, and write walkthroughs on a couple of the features. This is beneficial to all parties. The students learn about a tool/app and the content they write can be used as teaching material for other students like as with the custom searches in the other par of the assignment.

We think that the best kind of assignment will incorporate ways for students to share what they've learned with each other. Someone who completes this assignment may become a <a href="http://qsapp.com/">Quicksilver</a> devotee and share that with others. Then everyone will be more productive and happy!

# Our tips on teaching technology!
[toggle title= "When Planning the Lesson"]
## When Planning the Lesson
<ul>
	<li>Know the main terms used to operate the technology and/or tech tool</li>
	<li>Use everyday terms in the lesson plan illustrating what the term means (or, if it's not necessary, don't even reference the term at all)</li>
	<li>Writing a tech lesson has similar structure:
<ul>
	<li>title, introduction to the material, why it is important to those you are teaching, explain terminology that your pupils may not know, how to set up and start using the technology, possible pros and cons, the etiquette of the technology, and your personal suggestions (from experience) on how to use the technology</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Be selective and careful when choosing the technology you want to teach, how you want to teach it, and how you want to present it</li>
	<li>You have the choice to offer them the best option that is most pertinent and helpful to them or the alternatives so they can make the decision on what tools they want to use.
<ul>
	<li>Which ones you use is your choice.</li>
	<li>Just make sure your skill level lies somewhere between proficient to  expert on these tools. You should be able answer the students' inquisitive questions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
[/toggle]

[toggle title="When Creating Teaching Aides"]
## When Creating Teaching Aides
Create a** handout or presentation** for the students to follow along.

These are helpful in engaging their attention at the time and a useful tool for the future!

When creating the teaching aids (handouts and presentations) write it with your students in mind:
<ul>
	<li>Write specific content that is related to those you are teaching and the technology that you are teaching.</li>
	<li>Provide examples and use terminology that your listeners can understand.</li>
	<li>Don’t assume that your students know certain things.</li>
</ul>
[/toggle]

[toggle title="When teaching the lesson"]
## When Teaching the Lesson
When speaking engage them*** verbally, visually, and mentally***

This can be done by speaking in a fluctuating voice, making eye contact, creating presentation and handouts to aide the presentation, and ask questions along the way.

These questions can be gauging questions to see how much your students are understanding your lecture, a way to engage your audience, and even see what types of teaching style (tone, presentations style, stance, layout of content, joke, or even story).

This shows that you really want to work with your students and that you are putting time in for them!

When teaching technology, take time to help them set up an account or install an app. Walk around the room and help those who look confused. Body language says a lot!!!
