<hr />

For this assignment you will be using Photoshop and InDesign to create a poster with data visualizations.

Please use data from the [Census Quick Facts: Watsonville, CA](http://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045214/0683668,00)
## Making Your Data Tell a Story
The purpose of data visualizations are to clearly represent and connect different data points for a main message.  For example, if we want to show the correlation between education and poverty levels, we would connect data points like percentage of high school graduates, percentage of Bachelor degrees and persons below poverty level.  Analyze the available data set from the Census Quick Facts: Watsonville, CA -- if you notice interesting connections between data points, visualize them together and frame your message around that.
## How to Credit the Authors
Flat Icon is a great resource and they are kind enough to give out these great graphics for free, so we must remember to credit the authors.  After you download the flat icon, a pop up will appear:

If you are displaying your graphics on a website, you will copy and paste their link to credit the author.  The link translates into this text:
<div><strong>Icons made by [Freepik](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik) from [www.flaticon.com](http://www.flaticon.com) is licensed by [CC BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)</strong></div>

<div>Copy and paste this at the bottom right corner in small text.</div>
