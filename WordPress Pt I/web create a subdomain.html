Having your own domains means that you have complete control over what goes on it. If you discover that you don't like WordPress and would like to try something different you're well within your ability to do that. There is a wide world of software out there just waiting to get installed onto your website. Want to use Drupal? No problem! Want your website to have a wiki? Easy!
## Creating a New Subdomain
A subdomain is a word that appears before your website name. Right now we're on "class.giip.org". To submit your assignments, you visit "labs.giip.org". "class" and "labs" are both subdomains.

We use subdomains to show that one part of the website is quite different from another part. labs.giip.org serves a very different from giip.org, so we put it into its own subdomain. Likewise, class.giip.org, while still being a WordPress site, serves a very different function from giip.org so we put it on its own subdomain. Subdomains just keep things neat.
### Step 1: Log in to your cPanel
If you forgot how to do this, click here. If you want to change your unrememberable password, click here.


### Step 2: Find the Subdomains Tab
Scroll down to the "Domains" section and choose "Subdomains"


### Step 3: Enter the Name of Your New Subdomain


Click create after your you've decided what you want it to say. Remember, this is what will go before your site name.

You don't need to put any thing in "Document Root". A new folder will be created automatically.
## Installing a New Platform
Here's where it gets exciting. Softaculous comes preloaded with a plethora of different types of software for you. There are all sorts of blogging platforms, CMSs, Wikis, and Learning Management Systems. We highly encourage you to play around with them.
### Step 1: Click on "Softaculous" Under the "Software/Services" Section
This is the same thing you did when you first installed WordPress.


### Step 2: Chose What Platform You Want to Install
Over on the left sidebar, you'll see the different categories of software platforms you can install.

There are far, far to many to get into here, so we're just going to show you a couple basic installations.
For now, just click on the "Wikis" tab.

### Step 3: Evaluate Which One to Use
This step can be kind of rushed since you can always just uninstall the platform if you find you don't like it.

We see before us a list of the different Wiki softwares we can install.





MediaWiki says that it's the same software that Wikipedia used to use, but its 66MB and that's a large portion of your server space. DokuWiki is lighter and says that it's for easily setting up a wiki for a working group for an organization. Let's give it a try. Like we said, you can always just uninstall it.Â You also ought to hit the Demo button and read some reviews before installing.

Simply click on "DokuWiki" and then click Install.
### Step 4: Set Your Details


Under "Choose Domain" select the subdomain that you want it on. I created a sub called "wiki" so that's what I choose. Also don't forget to erase whatever is in the "In Directory" field.



Here set your login credentials. Remember to never keep the admin username 'admin'. You must change the username and password to something secure or you risk being hacked. Enter your email at the bottom to be sent a log of this installation, and hit Install.
### Step 5: Check Out Your New Wiki!
As you can see, Softaculous gives you the links to your public site and administration area.


### Step 6: Uninstall
If you find that you don't like this platform, simply uninstall it. Up at the top right of Softaculous, click on the little crate icon that says, "All Installations". It will bring you to a list of all your installed platforms.



All you need to do to get the install off your subdomain is click the red X and then click "Remove Installation". Poof! It's gone!

## Installing a New Platform WITHOUT a Subdomain
Do the installation steps like normal, but specify the name of the directory you want created. Let's create a Forum for my website to see how this works.
### Step 1: Choose to Install "Simple Machine Forums (SMF)" Under the "Forums" Tab
SMF is one of the most popular forum platforms on the web. If you've ever used a forum, odds are you've used SMF.

&nbsp;
### Step 2: Enter "Forums" into the "In Directory" Field


This creates a new directory in your root called "forums". Visitors will go to "www.yoursite.com/forums" to vist the forum section.

That's basically it, really. No further instructions.
## Why Bother with All This?
Well, you can learn a lot. It's empowering to take control of your website like this. Experiment with what's available to you. Search google for guides and ideas. Install, tinker, erase. Wash, rinse, repeat.
### Possible Project Application
Run writing and web design workshops for a group of teenagers. Create one central domain that acts as an information hub for the program and showcase for the writing of the students. Create for each of them a subdomain with an instance of WordPress installed. Give them near admin level access to it. Each student will be able to publish blog posts and writing projects on their own website which they are allowed to personalize and manage, while you still retain the ability to intervene if need be.
