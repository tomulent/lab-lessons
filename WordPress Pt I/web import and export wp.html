Sometimes you need to move a lot of content from one WordPress site to another. Conventional wisdom tells you to copy paste all you posts and pages, but that would take forever. We want something quicker. That's why we have an import and export function built into WordPress.
<h2>Exporting Content</h2>
This part is really easy. Just go to your menu and choose "Tools&gt;Export".

You can choose to export all content, or just pages or posts. Click "Download Export File" and you'll get an XML file.
<h2>Importing Content</h2>
This has more steps, but is also extremely easy. If you would like to follow along, downloadÂ WP Lab Easy Content which is contains some test posts and pages as well as a custom menu containing links to the CollegeBoard.org pages for every California public college. If you just want that custom menu, download CA Public Colleges Menu file. <strong>Note:</strong> These files are .zip files. You must open them to get to the XML file you need.
<h3>Step 1: Download the WP Importer</h3>
Go to "Tools&gt;Import" and select WordPress from the list of importers.

This will prompt a download confirmation screen to pop up. Click Install Now. Don't worry about security, this is made by WordPress.

<h3>Step 2: Select Your File To Import</h3>
Simply choose the file you want to import.

<h3>Step 3: Determine What User to Publish As</h3>
All WP posts and pages need to be attributed to an author. You have the option of creating a new user for these posts to be attributed to, or you can just assign an existing user to take credit for them.

<h3>Step 4: You're Done!</h3>
You may see a bunch of notices that "Failed to import.....". That just means that it couldn't download attached image files. You may have to move over images manually.
