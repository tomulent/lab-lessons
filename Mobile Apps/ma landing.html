Mobile applications are at the forefront of technology. Think of how often you use them each day. Yet at the same time they seem so different. Where do they come from? Who builds them? How many years at genius camp do you need to spend before you're qualified to make them. The answers to those questions are: Computers. Anyone. Zero.
<h2>What to Expect From This Series</h2>
This lesson series will take you from the most basic knowledge towards being able to bring your completed app to the app store.
<h2>What Do I Need?</h2>
A computer with an internet connection. You're reading this so we assume you can manage that. Aside from that a text editor like TextWrangler or Notepad ++.
<h2>What Can These Apps Do?</h2>
Strictly speaking nothing. They don't play games, send messages, or do your taxes. They are static for the time being, but there's plenty you can do with a static app. Check out what the kids at the <a href="http://summerinstitute.giip.org">Youth Empowerment Institute</a>Â were able to do in just 5 days: <a href="http://summerinstitute.giip.org/app">WHS College Mentor App</a>.
<h2>Where Do I Start?</h2>
Please begin with week zero. It will layout the requisite software and help orient you with some of the conventions you'll need to follow to stay organized.

<p class="p1"><b>Attendance</b></p>
<p class="p2">You are expected to be in class each week, prepared and on time. If you cannot make it to class for whatever reason, you will be responsible for obtaining the information we covered in class from one of your classmates, or meeting me by appointment for further clarification. If you must miss class (sick, etc.) you must email the lab leader. Failure to notify the lab leader and facilitator by email will result in being marked absent. Each unexcused absences after two result in a 10% penalty to your overall grade in the lab</p>
<p class="p2">All resources and assignments will be posted on labs.everettprogram.org. Read everything. If a resource is optional, it will be labeled as such in its title. You will be responsible for this information on the midterm and for use on your final project, although it may not be reiterated in class.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Homework</b></p>
<p class="p2">All assignments are due 1 week after they were assigned. An email will be sent out on Fridays detailing your homework for each week. Please pay attention to the method by which to submit these assignments, as they may vary. You may submit up to one week late and receive up to 50%. If you did your work on time but got a bad grade, you have the option of resubmitting no later than one week after the due date, and changing your received grade up to 70%.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Academic Integrity</b></p>
<p class="p2">Cheating on exams and plagiarism are examples of violations in the realm of ethics and integrity. If you have any questions on what constitutes both good scholarship or the consequences of failing to work within campus expectations of honesty and professionalism, please view the available resources through the Division of Undergraduate Education (http://www.ue.ucsc.edu/ai_resources).</p>
