### What is it?
With more than 380 million members, LinkedIn is the most popular social network for professionals *and *one of the top social networks overall. The goal of the site is to allow registered members to establish and document networks of people they know and trust professionally. A LinkedIn member’s profile page, which emphasizes employment history and education, has professional network news feeds and a limited number of customizable modules. Basic membership for LinkedIn is free and network members are called “connections.” Unlike other free social networking sites like Facebook or Twitter, LinkedIn requires connections to have a pre-existing relationship.

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Experience: Make sure that this section is complete and addresses all of the work you have done. This is a great place to give employers, companies, and individuals a really good idea of who you are and what you do. Also update your skills at the bottom so you can be endorsed by others as a form of validation.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Endorsing someone and having them endorse you back (similar to following) is important for LinkedIn.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">**Craft a powerful title** for Your LinkedIn profile. Unless someone clicks on your full profile, your name and title are the only things visible on LinkedIn lists, such as the list of "People Also Viewed" and “People You May Know,” as well as when you accept someone’s invite to connect.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">So make your title **stand out** by saying what you do and for whom
<ul>
	<li>For a designer: “Helping Law Firms &amp; Financial Services Companies Elevate Their Brand &amp; Bottom Line” (instead of the more generic, and much more common, “Graphic Designer”)</li>

[toggle title="Making Projects Dynamic"]

In your school and job career you may work in projects with others. LinkedIn has a section that that allows you to features you projects, just fill in the section called 'Projects'. This section is unique and dynamic in the fact that it allows you too add other members who contributed to the project. Connecting your projects with those you have connected to on LinkedIn.

The way to achieve this goal is by logging into your LinkedIn account. Go to your profile, and turn the editing setting on. Scroll down to your projects section and click add new or edit an old project. On this section you can update an old project or add a new project. For either of the cases you can add or delete members who were a part of the project. Connecting your collaborators to a project is beneficial to the both of you, since they're getting rep from it as well. See the image below for what the editing screen looks like and what you can add.

[toggle title="Workin' your endorsements and experience sections!"]

## Working your *endorsements* and *experience* sections!
By filling in the endorsements and experience sections you are ready to network on LinkedIn!
At this point be sure that:

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Your experience section is written clearly, and with enough description of the work you did so that a stranger reading your profile would be impressed!
<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">see the general tips section for examples of recommended ways of filling in experience sections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">you have at least 20 skills that are related to the work you want to do in the future</li>
</ul>
Like all social media, endorsing and reciprocating someone endorsing you is proper etiquette to follow!
Do this by:

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">**endorsing** someone else!
<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">you can do this in these various ways
<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">search  a connections name</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">above the portion of the their profile picture and title this should show</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/T.Ikemiya___LinkedIn.png)</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Select the skills you want to endorse. You can even add a skill you know they have!</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>and/or this way:
<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">go to the skills section of one of your connections</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">then click on the little plus symbol near the skills they have written up!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Taylor_Ikemiya___LinkedIn.png)
<ul>
	<li>**Having a person endorse you** the same way you have endorsed them.
<ul>
	<li>this shows that you have support in flaunting the given skill, as others know you have it too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>**Have a person write you a recommendation** on a mutual experience
<ul>
	<li>This is done separately by the person recommending you, ensuring that you have no control over editing the content someone has written about you, thus giving credibility to you and your recommender.</li>
	<li>The person will recommend you (the steps are shown below) and you will receive an email from LinkedIn stating that a person has written a recommendation for you.</li>
	<li>If you want to have the recommendation to show, then follow the process highlighted in the email!</li>
	<li>This is what is should look like when they write the recommendation!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/rec___LinkedIn.png)
<ul>
	<li>**Write a recommendation** for a linkedIn connection you have worked with
<ol>
	<li>Scroll down to the recommendation panel of your connection and click on the blue link 'Recommend connection first name'![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/rec1.png)</li>
	<li>The link from step leads to this page. Just fill in this page and send the recommendation!![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Recommendations___LinkedIn_and_Edit_Page_‹_Everett_Labs_—_WordPress1.png)</li>
	<li>The connection being recommended will receive an email asking if they want this endorsement to show on their profile.</li>
	<li>You recommendation will show on their profile if they choose to post it up!</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>**Send messages to your connections** to inquire about anything professional.
<ol>
	<li>Search for one of you connections</li>
	<li>In the top section of your connections profile [the part with their profile picture and etc] there will be a message box. Click on the 'Send a Message' or 'InMail' box to  go to the screen.![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Taylor_Ikemiya___LinkedIn1.png)</li>
	<li> Fill out this message box that pops up! Make sure the message is written professionally. This a professional online network, so keep it professional and grammatically correct. Look at the examples posted below.
<ol>

[toggle title="Requesting a Recommendation"]
Be proactive! Don't assume that your connections are just going to take it upon themselves to sit down and write nice things about you. Go ahead and ask. You can do this anytime, but some people like to coincide it with an upcoming grad school application or job search. Decide for yourself if you'd rather cultivate these things over time or madly scramble for them leading up to a deadline.

## Finding the Request Page
They decided to put the link to the Request Recommendations page in an odd place if you ask me.

Start by mousing over your portrait in the upper right toolbar, then clicking on "**Privacy &amp; Settings**". Once you're there, find the link under Profile Settings that says, "**Manage Recommendations**". Once you're there, click on the "**Ask For Recommendations**" tab and start requesting!

You'll need to specify what position/experience you want them to write the recommendation for. Then you'll choose up to three people to send the request to.
