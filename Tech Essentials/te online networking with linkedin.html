<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Adding a <strong>profile picture</strong></li>
</ul>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4070 size-full" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/skitch_iphoto.export.skitch-23.png" alt="skitch_iphoto.export.skitch 2" width="655" height="290" />
<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Creating a 'live' resume</strong> requires filling in ALL subsections and keeping the backgrounds sections up to date
<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Experience: Make sure that this section is complete and addresses all of the work you have done. This is a great place to give employers, companies, and individuals a really good idea of who you are and what you do. Also update your skills at the bottom so you can be endorsed by others as a form of validation.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Endorsing someone and having them endorse you back (similar to following) is important for LinkedIn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4071 size-full" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/skitch_iphoto.export.skitch-33.png" alt="skitch_iphoto.export.skitch 3" width="662" height="540" />
<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Find groups to join, follow, and contribute to.</strong><img class="alignnone wp-image-4072 size-full" src="http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/skitch_iphoto.export.skitch-42.png" alt="skitch_iphoto.export.skitch 4" width="344" height="408" /></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Craft a powerful title</strong> for Your LinkedIn profile. Unless someone clicks on your full profile, your name and title are the only things visible on LinkedIn lists, such as the list of "People Also Viewed" and “People You May Know,” as well as when you accept someone’s invite to connect.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">So make your title <strong>stand out</strong> by saying what you do and for whom
<ul>
	<li>For a designer: “Helping Law Firms &amp; Financial Services Companies Elevate Their Brand &amp; Bottom Line” (instead of the more generic, and much more common, “Graphic Designer”)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

In your school and job career you may work in projects with others. LinkedIn has a section that that allows you to features you projects, just fill in the section called 'Projects'. This section is unique and dynamic in the fact that it allows you too add other members who contributed to the project. Connecting your projects with those you have connected to on LinkedIn.

The way to achieve this goal is by logging into your LinkedIn account. Go to your profile, and turn the editing setting on. Scroll down to your projects section and click add new or edit an old project. On this section you can update an old project or add a new project. For either of the cases you can add or delete members who were a part of the project.

<p style="text-align: left;">[toggle title="Requesting a Recommendation"]</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Be proactive! Don't assume that your connections are just going to take it upon themselves to sit down and write nice things about you. Go ahead and ask. You can do this anytime, but some people like to coincide it with an upcoming grad school application or job search. Decide for yourself if you'd rather cultivate these things over time or madly scramble for them leading up to a deadline.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Finding the Request Page</h2>
They decided to put the link to the Request Recommendations page in an odd place if you ask me.

Start by mousing over your portrait in the upper right toolbar, then clicking on "<strong>Privacy &amp; Settings</strong>". Once you're there, find the link under Profile Settings that says, "<strong>Manage Recommendations</strong>". Once you're there, click on the "<strong>Ask For Recommendations</strong>" tab and start requesting!

You'll need to specify what position/experience you want them to write the recommendation for. Then you'll choose up to three people to send the request to.
