### Basics of CiviCRM
[toggle title="Contacts"]
Keeping tract of members, volunteers and donors is the most essential task of running a non-profit, that is why contacts are so important that the CiviCRM users book describes contacts as "the centre of your CiviCRM universe". Contacts also connects with other CiviCRM features tightly because it records a contact's attendance to events, contributions, membership status, and more. When users are viewing a contact, it lists the contact's demographic and basic information as well as its interaction with your organization and relationships with other contacts.
CiviCRM offers three different types of contacts:

<ol style="padding-left: 60px;">
	<li>individuals: obviously, this includes persons such as members, volunteers, donors etc. that your organization keeps contact with.</li>
	<li>organizations: other non-profit organizations, groups, or companies that work with your organization.</li>
	<li>Households: "typically families that share a physical location", according to the users book.</li>
</ol>
CiviCRM also allows configuration of sub contact types. For instance, individuals can be divided into students, staff, volunteers, etc. And organizations can have subtypes like team, committee, sponsors and more.
