## Other Civi Components
The only reason I'm writing this section of the lesson is because I want to let you know how much more you can do with CiviCRM. I hope this inspires you to learn more about CiviCRM, and help organizations with the knowledge you acquired.

<h3>[CiviReport ](http://book.civicrm.org/user/current/reporting/what-is-civireport/)</h3>
CiviReport is the component that allows you to create and view brief summaries of your data. this component integrates with other CiviCRM components. For instance, you can generate a list of  contacts in a group or with a certain tag, create a monthly summary of the contributions you received, etc. And these reports can be emailed directly from CiviCRM or exported.

<h3>[CiviCase ](http://book.civicrm.org/user/current/case-management/what-is-civicase/)</h3>
CiviCase primarily works with the "Activity" tool in CiviCRM. It documents more complex interactions between you and your constituent or staff. The "Activity" function allows you to keep records of interviews, meetings, phone calls and more, and schedule followups. By using CiviCase and Activity, users increase efficiency and have better workflow.

<h3>[CiviCampaign  ](http://book.civicrm.org/user/current/campaign/what-is-civicampaign/)</h3>
When you're organizing a campaign, a lot goes into it. You gather a group of people to work on the campaign, send out emails to your supporters, plan events to raise fund, etc. You already know how to do all of them on CiviCRM, but you kind of need something to connect them together to be more organized. Well, that's when CiviCampaign comes to save your life. According to the[ CiviCRM Users Book](http://book.civicrm.org/user/current/campaign/what-is-civicampaign/), "CiviCampaign lets you link together events, mailings, activities, and contributions under one "umbrella" so that you can track the progress of all your efforts towards one programmatic goal or campaign."  CiviCampaign also include two other components: [CiviSurvey](http://book.civicrm.org/user/current/survey/what-is-civisurvey/) and [Civipetition](http://book.civicrm.org/user/current/petition/what-is-civipetition/).

<h3>[CiviGrant](http://book.civicrm.org/user/current/grants/what-is-civigrant/)</h3>
If your organization gives out fund or grants, like the Everett Program does, you know CiviContribute is not enough to keep track of your monetary flow. It also helps you keep track of the application process, applied amount, received amount, and more.

## Project 2
### My last words for you:
It is a pity that we had such limited time to work with CiviCRM, and I only could cover so little. CiviCRM is a truly powerful tool for non-profit organizations and I encourage you all to explore the [CiviCRM Books](http://book.civicrm.org/), which includes a Users Guide, Documentation Wiki, and Developers Documentation, on your own to gain better and more thorough understanding of CiviCRM.

### Why I assigned this project:
After 9 weeks of using CiviCRM, I believe you have gained a decent understanding of how to use most of the tools, and how to work with the system. However, to learn is one thing, and to teach is another. Given the situation that many of you will be working with your partner organization and help them transferring to using CiviCRM, it is important for you to acquire the skills to give clear explanation and instructions. What you’ll need to do for this final, is to develop a short lesson for one of the topic/tools that are listed down below. Some of the tools/topics are new and have not been taught, because that’s what you might face when you’re working with an organization; they might want you to figure out something you don’t know, and you will need to know where to find the answer, digest it, and present it to the organization. To be fair, for the ones that we’ve already touched on, I will assign new elements in the lesson. Each topic is linked to the CiviCRM Users Book, which should be the primary resource to get answers from. Your projects will all be graded by Yang.

### Requirements and expectation
<ul>
	<li>A write up:
<ul>
	<li>The write up should be at least **800** words. No maximum word count.</li>
	<li>While designing your write-ups, please think about these questions: What does the tool do? Where can it be used? How can it be used? Why is it important? And why should we use them? These questions are suggestions, which means you don’t have to answer all of them, but should follow along the direction.</li>
	<li>Make sure you **cite your sources** when you use quotations. (It doesn’t have to be very formal, just mention them like I did in my lessons. )</li>
	<li>Your write up also need to include at least **one example** of using the function/tool</li>
	<li>Your writing matters. It doesn’t have to be beautifully written, but good spelling, grammar and coherence will get you more points.</li>
	<li>This is not an essay. Use titles and format your write up that makes reading comfortable.</li>
	<li>Be as detailed and thorough as possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>A step by step instruction with **screenshots**:
<ul>
	<li>It could be how to set up the tool or how to use the tool.</li>
	<li>I recommend using Skitch for taking screenshots, because it’s easier to draw arrows, add captions, and highlight, but whichever way works for you is okay.</li>
	<li>There are no limitation of how many screenshots to include, but the instructions should be clear.</li>
	<li>You may have to create fake/dummy data to take screenshots. Please do so when it’s needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Each topic have different required elements that I want you to touch on, so please make sure you include them in the lesson.</li>
	<li>Save everything in the same file and in **PDF** format. Name it **Lastname_PJ2, and email it to **[**civicrm@labs.everettprogram.org**](mailto:civicrm@labs.everettprogram.org)** by 06/10 Wednesday by midnight. **</li>
