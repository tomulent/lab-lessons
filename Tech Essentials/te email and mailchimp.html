###  A Note About The Structure of This Lesson
<div>We're always trying to improve how we teach and how we arrange data. To determine what's the best way to arrange a lesson, we're performing a test this week and you all are the guinea pigs. The lessons have been getting really long. We partially solve this by using "toggles", which are those expanding and  folding widgets that you click on to reveal content. You should've seen the lessons before we started using those things! Still with the toggles, the pages can get cluttered so this lesson we'll do things differently.</div>

<div>The various modules of this lesson have been moved off the page and into individual posts. This means that instead of one long page with all the information on it, you see a shorter page with headings that introduce each topic and links to a post teaching that topic. This way, you don't need to scroll through a mile-long page.</div>

<div>We're counting on you to tell us which version you like better. Try them both out and think about which works better for you as you work through the lesson and do your homework.</div>

<div>Your evaluation of the lesson has been made part of your graded homework for this week.</div>
### Outcomes for this lesson:
<ul>
	<li>Getting familiar with and evaluating email services and related tools to facilitate timely and efficient networking.</li>
</ul>
### Why this maybe important to you:
Connecting smoothly and efficiently with collaborators and partners is crucial in a world of global networks. Mass email services allows you to initiate and maintain contact with partners, donors, and volunteers.

## What is Email?
Emails are digital messages that are tied to a specific **address **and is stored on a server (a remotely accessible computer).

Email is possibly the most important form of communication to master for your professional development, as it is the preferred method of communication for most people. Attaining familiarity with certain aspects of it will help you greatly in your networking efforts.
## How to Get to Your Gmail Settings
A lot of the things in this lesson require you to change your email settings, so here's how to do that.
<ol>
	<li>Go to the Gear under your email address.</li>
	<li>Select settings</li>
	<li>You will be offered a variety of tab options. Look at all of the options you have! Usually, you will be directed to your General Settings. (First tab on the left).</li>
</ol>
If you love keyboard shortcuts you have got to check out this section in the settings: Go to settings and scroll down until you see this:

[toggle title="Email Clients"]

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mail_client_-_Google_Search.png)

**Email Client**: Any application (desktop, mobile, or web) through which email is composed, sent, and received. Basically any program you use to get or send your email is an **email client**.
<ul>
	<li>**Web Client aka "Web Mail"**: Probably the client you're most familiar with, theses are websites you go to to check your email. Gmail.com is a web-based email client. Yahoo mail is a web mail client. Some open source clients include Roundcube and Squirrel Mail.</li>
	<li>**Mobile Client**: An app on your phone that syncs up with your mail server.</li>
	<li>**Desktop Client**: Applications on your computer that sync with your mail server.</li>
</ul>
## A Weird, Drawn Out Metaphor
A lot of people think of their preferred email client as "their email", when really it's a method of accessing their email. Your email is actually a collection of data that is set up to be accessed via a standard protocol.

Still not making sense? Einstein was famous for his thought experiments and we're about as smart as him so let's do one.

Imagine all your email as if it were actual mail. Every message in your inbox is writtend onto a piece of 8.5x11 white paper and laid out in a giant grid afixed to a flat surface. This flat surface is hanging from a a perfectly stable hot air balloon facing the ground. This is your email. It's your messages, ready to be viewed.

So you know where your email is but how do you view it? You need a mail client! You go down to the general store and buy one. It's a strange contraption made of gears and ornate lenses. You set it up near your floating email and flip various toggles and pull some levers and the contraption (mail client) focuses on one particular 8.5x11 sheet of paper with the most recent email on it. You marvel at what you've got in front of you and say, "Gee? Mail." Thus Gmail was born.

You decide that you don't like the way this particular contraption (mail client) works, so you go back to the store and get a different one. You set it up right next to the old one and get to work. You dangle a carrot on a stick in front of the donkey that powers this contraption (mail client) and it gets to displaying you the emails you tell it to.

Both your contraptions (mail clients) are still working and indeed you can switch between the two. The contraption (mail client) that you use to view the floating array of messages is incidental. They are just different ways of accessing the same data.

This is the point we're trying to impress upon you. The application you use to view your email is **not** your email, just one one of many ways of viewing it. Your email is a collection of data that you own and can forward, download, or view in whatever way you see fit.

Email Clients are apps (web, desktop, and mobile) that allow us to interact with our email.

[toggle title="Delivery Protocol: POP vs. IMAP"]

When choosing which [email client](http://labs.everettprogram.org/tech-essentials/email-clients/) to use on your phone or and how to set them up, be mindful of the protocol involved. This discussion is kind of a moot point in this day and age, but we'll touch on it briefly.

Basically, there are two protocols for mail delivery to choose from:
<ul>
	<li>**POP**:Post Office Protocol</li>
	<li>**IMAP**: Internet Message Access Protocol</li>
</ul>
We highly recommend checking out the site [pop2imap.com](http://www.pop2imap.com/) as it offers a simple explanation of the two and why POP is bad. There's no adds on this site and doesn't seem to advocate for any particular app, so I conclude it was made as a public service by people who hate the post office protocol. It offers a guide for all popular services to make sure you're using IMAP.

Basically, POP involves downloading copies from the mail server. Anything you do to these copies, like mark them as read or delete them, will not be reflected on the server. In an age of multiple devices, this causes a massive headache. Imagine reading 10 emails on your phone and then logging into your web client only to find that you have 10 unread messages. The messages you read on your phone didn't get marked as read because POP doesn't work that way.

These days we want everything to "sync", that is, when you change something on one device the changes should reflect on all devices. With IMAP, there is a two way communication between your client and the server so that any change made is reflected across every device.

[/toggle]

This section is about how email reaches your email client and is governed by a specific delivery protocol. There's a good one and a bad one and knowing which is which will help you out a lot.

[toggle title="Gmail Tricks"]

UCSC pays for a service called "Google Apps". This is a suite of products that allows an institution to create and manage users who all have the same set of functionality. Your @ucsc email address gives Gmail managed email, Google Drive, Google Sites, Google Calendar, and so on. Since you use this email the most (we assume), we're going to show you some neat tricks for it.
## Make "New" Accounts with Dots and Pluses
Sometimes you need to create multiple accounts for the same service. I do that all the time when I'm testing out how a new user would experience a site. Instead of making a new email, you could employ one of these tricks:
### Put A Dot In Your Address
Gmail doesn't care for dots. It doesn't even accept them as being there, it just filters them out. Thus, as far as Gmail is concerned, **yourname@gmail.com** is the exact same thing as **your.name@gmail.com**, which is the same as **y.o.u.r.n.a.m.e@gmail.com**. Gmail doesn't care about them, but a website would read them as different email addresses. Anything they send to **yo.ur.na.me@gmail.com** will get delivered to your mailbox.

**Note**: The dots trick does not work on @ucsc.edu accounts
### Put a Plus and Then Anything
You can append a "+" mark to your base address and get the same result. For example **yourname+testaccount@ucsc.edu** will seem like a new email address to a site like, say, [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/), but will get delivered to your mailbox.

This is potentially more useful than the dot methods because it allows you to set up filters more easily. Whenever I'm testing out a new site or making an account for one I already use to see what it's like for a new user, I use **myemail+testing@gmail.com**. I then set up a filter to send any email sent to **myemail+testing@gmail.com** to the trash, since I know it's not going to be useful information and I have a pathological hatred of useless mail cluttering my inbox.

[/toggle]

Your @ucsc.edu email address is administered by Gmail, which means that you have access to their lesser known tricks.

Link to post on Gmail Tricks-content [here](http://labs.everettprogram.org/tech-essentials/gmail-tricks/).

[toggle title="More Fun With Email: Disposable Addresses"]

Sometimes you don't want a site to even have any idea who you are and don't want to use the "+ trick" with gmail. That's when disposable email addresses come into play.

A disposable email address is just what it sound like. An email address that will be used maybe once and then deleted. Try using:
<ul>
	<li>[Guerrilla Mail](https://www.guerrillamail.com/)</li>
	<li>[10 Minute Mail](http://10minutemail.com/)</li>
</ul>
![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/✉_Guerrilla_Mail_-_Disposable_Temporary_E-Mail_Address-300x214.png)

Sometimes you don't want a website to know your email address. Luckily, there are ways of creating an email address that will exist for just 10 minutes!

[toggle title="Signatures"]
### What Are Email Signatures and Why Are They Important?
Signatures are a cool and simple way to personalize your emails. When you send an email with a signature, you are adding a personal touch with important information. Best of all, you don't have to re-type this in every email! It will automatically set itself into all emails you send, making you look super official and classy with a click of a button!
### Set Up a Signature
<ul>
	<li>Go to settings in your Gmail account.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Under General, scroll down to the very bottom where it says "signatures"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Under signature, create your signature for this email address
<ul>
	<li>List what organizations you're involved with, your phone number, and any other important information you wish people to see when emailing.</li>
	<li>You can hyperlink text, insert image, and play with the formatting all you want!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
### 15 Common Email Signature Mistakes
This post from HubSpot will take you through the most common email signature faux pas's, like putting your email address in the signature, or inserting full URLs instead of hyperlinking text.

[toggle title="Gmail Vacation Mode Setting"]
### What is Gmail Vacation Mode?
Vacation mode, once turned on  in gmail settings,  send an automatic reply to the sender  of a message of you choice.
### When and way it can it be used?
*Vacation mode can be used when:*
<ul>
	<li>you are going on vacation and  need to  keep up business relationships &amp; correspondence</li>
	<li>the need to relay this information onto another person contacting you during this time.</li>
	<li>if you have changed you email address and need those contacting on the old email forward to the message to a new one.
<ul>
	<li>There are many other ways? What way do you think you can use other then the ones listed above?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
*Ways:* The messages can range from "I am on a personal/familial/business trip and am unable to respond until X day and time. Thank you, [Your Name]" to "I have changed my email address. If you could please forward you original message to my new email [type new email here] that would wonderful. Thank you for taking the time, [Your Name]" to "Thank you for  your email. I am not in the office on this day. I work X days at X times. I will respond to your email during those business hours. Thank you, [Your Name]".

These instances and ways are reasons why vacation mode is important!!
#### How you can use it!
<ol>
	<li> Login into you gmail account! [UCSC or personal gmail]</li>
	<li>Click on gear button on the right side. Then select setting underneath that tab.![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Inbox__1__-_mlonga_ucsc_edu_-_UC_Santa_Cruz_Mail.png)</li>
	<li>Scroll down the 'General' tab to section called 'Vacation responder'. It is right under 'Snippets'. Here you can edit and create you vacation autoemail response back here!</li>

[toggle title="Email Forwarding"]
### What is Email Forwarding?
Email forwarding allows you to forward specifically marked emails to other people or other emails. This makes it easy to organize and separate incoming mail. For example, you may keep getting mail from a service you subscribe to, but do not want to see the emails pile up in your UCSC inbox. You can forward them to a different email address that is less academically focused so you no longer receive the emails there, but rather in a more appropriate place. More so, you don't have to unsubscribe from the service!
### How Do Orgs Use Forwarding?
Orgs, like Everett, can create basically infinite email addresses on their domains. Some of them are for use by people, but some of them are more for processes. Look at the footer of this site and you'll see an email address for the tech director. Go on our [Contact Us](http://www.everettprogram.org/contact-us/) page on the main site and you'll see an email address that goes to "info@everettprogram.org". We also have several more that perform automated system announcements for other subdomains on everettprogram.org. How do we keep track of all this? Why would we create so many addresses? It's actually more efficient when you think about it.

Take the tech director email at the footer of this site. At time of writing, Thomas is the tech director, so why not just put his email address? Well what happens when Thomas leaves to accept a job at the [Sloth Sanctuary of Costa Rica](http://www.slothsanctuary.com/)? You would have to change that. Same goes for the info email. It doesn't need to go to a particular person. Whenever we create a new email address that won't be regularly checked, we simply set up a forwarder so that it automatically goes to one of the staff.
### How Do You Use Forwarding in Gmail?
1. Go into your Settings for the email you wish to forward mail *from.*

2. Select the "Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab"

3. Click "Add forwarding address here"

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/skitch_iphoto.export.skitch-21.png)

This window should pop-up:

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/skitch_iphoto.export.skitch-51.png)

4. In the search bar at the top of your page (notice the blue magnifying glass icon), search for the types of emails you wish to forward.

5. You will then input the email address you are forwarding *from *in the first bar. Then, the email you're forwarding *to *in the second bar. Please take note of the designated spaces below:

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/skitch_iphoto.export.skitch-31.png)

6. For your security, Google sends a verification email to that address. Open your other email account and find the confirmation message from the Gmail team. If you’re having trouble finding it, check your Spam folder

7. Click the verification link in that email

8. Back in your Gmail account, reload the page in your web browser - look for the reload icon

9. On the same **Forwarding and POP/IMAP** page in Settings, check that **Forward a copy of incoming mail** is selected and your email address is in the drop-down menu

10. In the second drop-down menu, choose what you want Gmail to do with your messages after they’re forwarded, such as **keep Gmail’s copy in the Inbox** (recommended) or **archive Gmail’s copy**.

11. Click **Save Changes** at the bottom of the page.

Now you're set! Any emails sent to this address will be forwarded to your specified address. Go ahead and test it out.

[/toggle]

Sometimes you have an email address that you want to keep, but don't want to check. Email forwarding will keep you from missing important communications on accounts you no longer use on a regular basis.

[toggle title="Use Gmail As a Mail Client for Multiple Accounts"]

If you really like Gmail's user interface (UI) and you want to manage all your emails from one place, you can set it up to handle multiple accounts.

Let's call our two email addresses "Primary Account" and "Secondary Account". Where "Primary Account" is the one that we want to be able to send and receive for both.
### Step One: Set Up a Forwarder
Using the [instructions](#forwarder) in the other part of this lesson, set email from Secondary Account to forward to "Primary Account"
### Step Two: Add a "Send Mail As" Address
In the Primary Account, go to "**Settings &gt; Accounts and Import**". Go to "**Send Mail As**" and click to "**Add another email address you own**"
### Step Three: Fill In the Required Info
You'll be prompted to enter the info and then supply a verification code that they'll send you.
### Step Four: Send From Either Account
You can now choose which account to send from when composing emails.

[/toggle]

If you have multiple email accounts that you use regularly, but don't want to keep switching between them and for whatever reason don't want to use a desktop client, you can use Gmail to manage multiple accounts.

[toggle title="Filter Your Email: Clean up, Organize, and Stay that Way!"]
### What are Filters?
Filters are exactly what they sound like: a way to filter where your mail goes, how it is sorted, if it is read or unread, and if you wish to have it placed in your junk folder! Sometimes, email can be overwhelming. If so, don't sweat it! Simply change the filter settings of your email to help organize your email before you even read them for the day!
### Why is it important?
Staying organized and efficient gets difficult to do the more you have on your plate. Email is something we all actively use, for better and for worse. Looking at your inbox on Sunday night can be a nightmare... Do not fret! With filters, you can easily change the way your email operates, saving you time and brain power when searching through your emails.
### How do you use it?
1. Open Gmail.

2. Click the down arrow in your search box. A window that allows you to specify your search criteria will appear.

3. Enter your search criteria. If you want to check that your search worked correctly, click the search button.

4. Click **Create filter with this search **at the bottom of the search window. If you need to verify the search results, you can click the **x** to collapse the filter options. Clicking the down arrow again will bring the window back with the same search criteria you entered.

5. Choose the action(s) you want the filter to take.

** To keep organized, many people like to have incoming messages automatically labeled and removed from their inbox until they can look at them later at a more convenient time. If you want to do this, make sure to select **Skip the Inbox (Archive it)** and **Apply the label:** when you create your filter.**

6. Click the **Create filter**
<h2>![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/skitch_iphoto.export.skitch-41.png)</h2>

5. Select the format in which you'd like to export your contacts' information. Please note, some of these formats can lose some contact information.
<ul>
	<li>To transfer contacts between Google accounts, use the **Google CSV** This is the recommended way to back up your Google Contacts.</li>
	<li>To transfer contacts to Outlook, Yahoo! Mail, Hotmail, or various other apps, use the **Outlook CSV **</li>
	<li>To transfer contacts to Apple Address Book, use the **vCard **format</li>
</ul>
6. Click **Export  **

7. Choose **Save to Disk** then click **OK**.

8. Select a location to save your file, and click **OK**.

9.** Importing **contacts into gmail is a bit more complicated, but you can learn it step by step [here](http://www.howtogeek.com/201988/how-to-import-export-contacts-between-outlook-and-gmail/).

[toggle title="Google Groups"]
#### What is Google Groups?
Google Groups is an innovative way to interact and collaborate with a set group of individuals through email or forums! It is useful to virtually get together to discuss projects or "meet" with group members. It has been used for just that, but also to keep track of running  a club or group of people about meetings, schedules, and much more. Google Groups makes emailing and talking to others easier, as they are part of your select group that acts as a condensed contact. When really, there are multiple people within the contact! This is important because it will help you stay organized when working with a select group of people. Projects, midterms, finals, and presentation groups are hard enough to manage, so why not place everyone in a virtual group to make it easy?

1. Log into your gmail account; click on the grid; select groups

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/skitch_iphoto.export.skitch1-218x300.png)

2. Select the red "Create Group" button on the top left hand side of the page

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/skitch_iphoto.export.skitch-2.png)

3. You will need to fill out informational settings for your group. If you create the group, you are the owner. This functions similarly to Google Docs. Change your basic permissions to fit your group's needs.

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/skitch_iphoto.export.skitch-5.png)

4. You will need to select the type of group. This is important because the type of group you select determines how your group members will interact with one another.

There are four choices:
<ul>
	<li>Email list: An email list allows users to post from the web or through email. This is a mailing list group.</li>
	<li>Web forum: A web forum allows people to interact with the group and have engaging and interactive discussions on the web. It has web optimized features enabled including moderation tools. Group members post topics and replies through the web interface, but can still receive updates via email.</li>
	<li>Q&amp;A forum: A web forum allows people to interact with the group and have engaging and interactive discussions on the web. It has web optimized features enabled including moderation tools. Group members post topics and replies through the web interface, but can still receive updates via email.</li>
	<li>Collaborative inbox: Topics can be assigned to other members and treated as tasks which can be resolved or reassigned. Additional options are available to control who can assign and receive tasks.</li>
</ul>
![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/skitch_iphoto.export.skitch-4.png)

5. Once you have finished selecting which settings you would like your group to have, select "Create Group" at the top of the page.

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/skitch_iphoto.export.skitch-3.png)

6. You should have a window pop up. This window allows you to invite people to the group via email. Please do so here.

# Email Campaigns
The bulk of this lesson has been about personal email. That's because it's so important to get your house in order and become the master of your own domain before you can be trusted with representing an organization over email. In this final section, we will talk about email campaigns, why they're important, and how to use a popular email service.
## Email vs. Email Campaign
Your personal email is meant to be a "one-to-one" correspondence. You are emailing one person, having a a conversation. Even if you have several people in the "Addressed To:" line, you can still think of it as being a proxy for standing around talking. There is an expectation that the people you're addressing will respond to you personally. Email campaigns are a different form of communication.

Campaigning means to work in an organized and active way toward a particular goal, and employing emails in this sense is like sending a mass. As such, an email campaign can be thought of as a "one-to-many" correspondence where one person (acting on behalf of an organization) is speaking to many people -possibly thousands or even millions- without the expectation of replies. At this point it's not a conversation anymore, it's an announcement.
## Examples of an Email Campaign
<ul>
	<li>A weekly newsletter</li>
	<li>A product announcement</li>
	<li>A plea for donations</li>
	<li>A call to a specific action; like a pledge, a vote, or signing a petition.</li>
</ul>
In all these cases, it's an org contacting multiple people, but those people would not actually reply to it via email. That's why these things are usually sent from addresses like, "no_reply@example.org". You would 'reply' in other ways like clicking the donate button or sharing it on social media (we call those "calls to action").
## Why You Should Know This
One of the most important ways that orgs have for raising money is through publication of newsletters and other such periodic contact with their constituents as these are things that can generate volunteers and donations. When you work with an organization it can be very helpful to teach them how to use campaign software so that they can develop their own channels of constituent relations. Expertise comes from experience, but at the very least this lesson will allow you to get your feet wet on the path to doing campaigns in in the field at a later point.
## Our Go To Software: MailChimp

## What is MailChimp?
From their website...
<blockquote>"More than 9 million people and businesses around the world use MailChimp. Our features and integrations allow you to send marketing emails, automated messages, and targeted campaigns. And our detailed reports help you keep improving over time.

Create signup forms that match your brand's look and feel, and send your subscribers product updates, event invitations, announcements, or editorial content."</blockquote>
Basically, MailChimp is an email service that allows you to send, create, and track massive amounts of emails in a cool and modern way! It is great for marketing campaigns or sending out newsletters. Many Non Profit Organizations (NPOs) or Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) utilize such email services to stay in contact with their supporters!

## Setting Up An Account
Go to [mailchimp.com](http://mailchimp.com) and click the sign up link. Fill in the info as the picture shows. For some reason, you need to supply a website URL. You don't need to confirm that you own it, so I'm not sure what purpose this serves, but you've got to jump through the hoops. Just use the Everett Program's URL, http://everettprogram.org and you should be fine.

## Read the "Getting Started with MailChimp" Guide
If you want a great, simple overview of what MailChimp does, what their terms mean, and how to...get started. Read this thing. MailChimp got as big as they have by being easy to use and they hired some great writers to put together their documentation. Find the Guide [here](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/account-setup/getting-started-with-mailchimp).
## Terminology
Like everything, MC has its own jargon.
### Campaign
In simplest terms, a campaign is an email sent out to a group of people. They use the term "campaign" because you should be thinking about the email as just one part of a larger effort to accomplish something, e.g. finding volunteers, soliciting donations, etc.
### Templates
The look and feel of the message that people will get
### List
A list is a list of contacts. These are important. They are the people you are sending emails to. MC allows you to have multiple lists, because people naturally should be divided into different audiences. For instance, Everett has a separate list for
<ul>
	<li>Current Students</li>
	<li>Alumni</li>
	<li>Donors</li>
	<li>Partners</li>
</ul>
These are different types of people who we have different messages to send to at different times. That's why lists are so important to an email campaign. They help you deliver the right message to the right people.
### Reports
MC allows you to see how many people opened your message, what they clicked on once they did, if they unsubscribed, and a plethora of other things. These are great to dork out over.
## Creating a List
## Setting Up a General Signup Form
Start by selecting "Lists" in the sidebar, and clicking "Create List" in the upper right corner.

Now just fill out the details in the list creation page. You'll need to supply a "from" email. This means the address that people see the message is from.

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Lists___MailChimp.png)
### Add Subscribers
There are two ways to add subscribers to a list
<ol>
	<li>Upload an existing contact sheet (like this [TE-mailchimp](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/TE-mailchimp.csv))</li>
	<li>Create a signup form</li>
</ol>
Click the "Signup Forms" tab to get started

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/chimp4.png)
### Choose "General Forms"
![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/chimp5.png)
## Build The Form!
This is the "Build It" Tab. You can drag and drop blocks onto the form to add or subtract what sort of information you want to collect in addition to the email address, like name, address, phone number, etc. On the right, you can set whether or not a field is required as well as some other information.

Something to remember when doing this for real orgs is that people will only be comfortable giving up so much information.

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/chimp6.png)
## Style the Form!
Make it fabulous with the style tab. On the top, select the form element and then customize to your heart's content.

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Form_and_Email_Designer___MailChimp.png)
## How Do People Use Your Form?
MC produces a URL for you to share.

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Form_and_Email_Designer___MailChimp1.png)

Emailing people a link to a signup sheet is not necessarily the best way to gain subscribers, but it will do for this lab. Once you get a website, you can make embeddable forms.

Go ahead and sign up for your own list! Give it a few minutes to show up.
# Your First Campaign
Ok now comes the good part. It's time to send something. Choose "Campaigns" from the sidebar and hit "Create a Campaign". Choose "Regular Ol' Campaign"

This lesson has gotten to be long enough, so we'll leave you here. It's pretty self explanatory and anything else you need to know will be present in MC's own guides. If you have any trouble, just click "Help" and search the knowledge base.
