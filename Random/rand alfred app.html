# What Is Alfred
Alfred is one of a class of applications know as "App Launchers". App launchers take over many functions of your default Finder application. They can open apps, move files, perform searches, and more. That might not sound all that useful but if you read this tutorial, you'll see how powerful an ally Alfred can be.

# Why Is This Useful?
At Everett, we don't care if you ever become a developer or an engineer. It's really not necessary. But we do encourage you to become a power user. A power user is someone who utilizes features and processes on their computer that most people don't. Most people don't use keyboard shortcuts, but those who do get work done way faster. Most people don't use the internal search functions of their OS, but those who do save themselves untold hours of frustrating sorting through folders.

Becoming a power user will help break down those last bits of tech fear that you may have. Your computer should be afraid of you, not you of it! We encourage you to fearlessly pursue stuff like this and take full ownership of your personal computer.
# Installing Alfred
Head on over to [alfredapp.com](http://alfredapp.com) and hit "**Download Alfred v2**". Once you've run the installer and moved the app to your Applications folder, go ahead and open it so we can get started.

# Getting Set Up
## Change The Hotkey
The whole idea behind Alfred is that you can do anything you want quickly. For this reason, we need to call up the search bar without making complicated hand gestures. By default, when you press Command + Spacebar, it will bring up Spotlight, Apple's native search function. We need to disable this and have that Alfred take it's place.
In the Apple Menu in the top left of the menu bar, go to **System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts**. Select "Spotlight" in the left pane and then uncheck the option "Show Spotlight search field"

Now that Spotlight is disabled, we can set Alfred to use that same hotkey. Click on the little hat icon that's appeared in the top right menu bar after opening Alfred and select "Preferences". Once there, you can click on the field next to "Alfred Hotkey" and press Command + Space. Voila! Alfred is now your default search bar and app launcher!

## Set The Search Scope
**Search Scope** refers to the folders that will be looked into when you perform a search. If you've ever been looking for something called "30a social enterprise deliverable". Then you could use Spotlight to search for that and it would probably find it. Spotlight's "Search Scope" is the entire hard drive, i.e. all your files. Alfred allows you to narrow the scope to a few folders, making for an easier search. Your computer has thousands and thousands of files on it that mostly don't relate to anything you're interested in. We want to exclude them from the search scope.

Below you will see the default options and search scope. To me, this is far too many places to be searching. I crave order, so I know that the only things I'll actually ever need to find are Applications, things in my personal folder, and things in my Box Sync folder where all my work related files are. So we're going to clear away all the default![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Alfred_Preferences_and_Add_New_Post_‹_Everett_Labs_—_WordPress.png)
### Changing the Search Scope
Highlight all of the folders and hit "Delete" to clear them all away. At this point you can add the folders that you want to constitute your search scope. You can select them individually by hitting the "Plus" button on the top right, or you can just drag them into the Search Scope box![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Fullscreen_11_20_14__1_21_PM.png)
## Set File Types
Lastly, you need to choose what types of files you want to show up in your search results. Personally, I have a lot of different types of files that I deal with, so my file types look like this.![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Alfred_Preferences1.png)
# Using Alfred
Ok finally we can use this thing! Take it for a test drive. To call up Alfred, just hit Command + Space
## Searching for Folders and Files
Let's use it to search for my folder that contains templates for bead sprites. As you recall, we set the Alfred hotkey to be Command + Space, so I'll push that and then type "beads" because I'm pretty sure that's what it's called.

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-20-at-1.42.28-PM.png)

Well hot dog! Now I don't have to fiddle around in the Finder! Just hit Return and you're there!
## Searching for Contacts
Alfred is not just for files and folders. You can also search contacts in your Address book. Let's say I want to send Aaron an email. I'd just type in "aaro" or "long" and it will come up with the desired contact

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-20-at-1.45.06-PM.png)
## Launch Apps
Type in the name of am app and hit Return. Just like searching for a file.

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-20-at-1.48.08-PM.png)

Notice that it also came back with two other documents that had the word "terminal" in their title. If I wanted one of those instead, I could hit Command + Number to open it instead. Or use the arrow keys to highlight the one I wanted and then Return to open it.
## Perform Web Searches
This is possibly the best part of Alfred. You can perform a web search without having to go to your browser and then navigate to the site that you want to search. It functions by accepting key words and search queries.
## Key Words
In Alfred Preferences, go to **Features &gt; Web Search**. Here you will find a list of all the active web searches you have along with the keywords needed to activate them. You can enable and disable them as you like.

**Keyword** means the word you would type to activate a search
**Query** means the thing that you're searching

For the example that we're about to do, I recommend a change first. On the line that says "Search Google Images for {query}" change the content of the "Keyword" column to read "img" instead of "images". this is purely for ease of use. ![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Alfred_Preferences2.png)
### Example In Action
One of the things I hate about Google Image search is that it's clunky to get to it. Alfred allows us to go there immediately. Let's say you're writing a term paper and all of a sudden want to look at baby elephants. Under normal circumstances you would:
<ol>
	<li>Open your browser</li>
	<li>Go to Google</li>
	<li>Switch over to Image search</li>
	<li>Search for images of baby elephants</li>
</ol>
With Alfred we can have the baby elephant mood strike and without leaving our paper, just type "img" and then "baby elephants" and hit enter to be taken straight to the image search results page.

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-20-at-2.06.48-PM.png)

In this case, the **Keyword** was "img". It tells Alfred that we want to do a search using Google Images. The **Query** is "baby elephants" as it is the thing that we're searching.

Now that you know how it's done, you can this syntax to perform other searches. Like:

## More Uses of Web Search
I give Alfred tremendous credit for making the following feature part of its free version. You can add your own custom searches. That might not sound all that cool at first but think of the implications for research. I'm a researcher and need to constantly be sifting through databases to find what I need. Once I discovered this function, my life got way better.

Using the library search functions can be a pain. There are all these steps you need to take to get yourself to the right research database or journal search. All the effort went into just getting my browser to whatever page contained the search bar, so Alfred let me cut out that process altogether.
## Setting Up Custom Searches
First a little word on how many searches work. A lot of the time, a search is a query to the database of a website. This query is performed by visiting a particular URL. Alfred works by saving this url and inserting a token where the actual search query would go.

In the following walkthrough, we'll learn how to set up a simple search on JSTOR. JSTOR is the worst thing ever, but you gotta use it.
### Step 1: Click "Add Custom Web Search" in the Web Search Pane of Alfred Preferences
This will get things ready but we won't use it quite yet
### Step 2: Perform a Search On the Desired Site
Go to [library.ucsc.edu/find/databases](http://library.ucsc.edu/find/databases) and choose JSTOR. Once there search for "ALIGATOR" or some other arbitrary word.
### Step 3: Copy the URL of the Results Page
<h3>![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-20-at-2.26.21-PM.png)Step 3: Go Back to Alfred and Paste this into the "Search URL" Field</h3>
### Step 4: Replace "ALLIGATOR" with {query}
Like I said before, sometimes a search is just a URL with the search term in a certain place. Take a look at the part that says "Query=ALLIGATOR". That's where the search happens. You need to replace ALLIGATOR with {query}.

![image](http://labs.everettprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Alfred_Preferences3.png)
### Step 5: Set The Title
The title is just the subtitle text that appears when you're writing the search. You can get fancy and use the {query} token and make it say something like, "Searching JSTOR for {query}"
### Step 6: Set the Keyword
As we discussed before, Keyword is the thing you type to let Alfred know you're performing a web search. I think the keyword "jstor" would be apropos.
### Step 7: Test Your Awesomeness
Take it for a test drive! Search for something and see if it works.

# Conclusion
Alfred is awesome. It allows you to cut lots of time spent navigating to get to the things you want and let you get there just by a few keystrokes.
## But What About the Windows People?!
You're right, we're not being fair here. We gotta write what we know and we don't know this for windows. Here is a list of [alternatives to Alfred](http://alternativeto.net/software/alfred/?platform=windows). Anyone who wants to write a Windows version of this post will earn our eternal gratitude.
