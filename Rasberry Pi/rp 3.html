<div><b>Objectives: </b></div>
<div>-Students are introduced to world of “hacking” and understand the importance of collaboration in computing by learning about the different projects that have emerged from Raspberry Pi.</div>
<div>-Students continue practicing Python and understanding it’s usefulness.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now that we have been introduced to both hardware and software, it’s time to get a little more hands on with our computers. This week we will be talking more about the Raspberry Pi, learning how we will be communicating with it, and understanding why we are even learning about it in the first place. We will also be covering some basics concepts of programming languages and will continue building our Python skills.</div>

<h2>The Raspberry Pi:</h2>
<div></div>
<div>Let’s start getting to know this technology a bit better, shall we? In order to do so, we need to get familiar with a very important resource. This resource will be your key into understanding what R.P. is, what people have done with it, and why it is important. This resource is, none other than…..</div>
<div></div>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">https://www.raspberrypi.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<div>I hope that wasn’t too much of a let down. This website is going to be your best friend for the next few weeks. You should have already been doing some looking as part of your assignment from last week. Let us go through each heading and see what it has to offer us.</div>
<div></div>
<h3>The Blog</h3>
<div>Here is where you can find the latest and greatest news regarding R.P. projects. It is very useful for learning about events going on around the world, as well as giving you a general snapshot of the R.P. community at work.</div>
<div></div>
<h3>Downloads</h3>
<div>Here is the where you will find the operating system software you will be downloading onto your SD cards next week. These resources are free and allow your Raspberry Pi to do all the cool things you have seen in the projects you have researched. Did I mention they’re free?</div>
<div></div>
<h3>Community</h3>
<div>This page gives you even more resources on finding more online projects from people who own Raspberry Pi’s. Visit these websites whenever you want to see what projects are out there. Remember, you are part of this community now too.</div>
<div></div>
<h3>Help</h3>
<div>The help page will be your guide when trying to understand how to first start up your PI. These are typically easy to follow videos that tell you point blank how to get started and will answer any FAQ’s.</div>
<div></div>
<h3>Forums</h3>
<div>Didn’t find the answer you were looking for in the resource guides? Forums are your next best bet. Forums are a new programmer's life source. Do not be afraid to post a question. Remember, there is no such thing as a stupid question. (Disclaimer: People on the internet will not be this nice and might not share the same sentiment. Ask anyways.)</div>
<div></div>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<div>Here you will find all the official documentation to easy to follow lesson plans you can do on your own and with your group. We will be coming back to this page in the upcoming weeks.</div>
<div></div>
<h2>So…..what does a microcontroller have to do with social justice again?</h2>
<div></div>
<div>Nothing really. Well, not by itself anyways.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Remember that in addition to trying to understand how computers work, one of the purposes of this class is to look at technology through a socially driven lens. Computing ties very well into this theme because of their immense scalability. Years ago computers were just used for military purposes. Now, they are embedded into almost every aspect of our lives. Computing has also brought people from all over the world to foster both virtual and physical communities of collaboration, innovation, and creative problem solving.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So, while there is no direct path we can follow that will tell us how to use Raspberry Pi’s for social justice purposes, we must pave the way. Keep in mind this important equation:</div>
<div></div>
<div>Cheap Resources + Creativity + Collaboration = Social Innovation.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<h2>In Class Assignment:</h2>
<div>Partner up and think of a way Raspberry Pi’s could be used for a sustainable issue in response to a social justice issue you care about. Could be a project you researched or one you thought of on your own (imagine you had all the money and time in the world!)</div>
<div>Answer key questions:</div>
<div>-what social justice issue?</div>
<div>-where?</div>
<div>-what role would the r.p. play?</div>
<div>-is there something other than R.P. that could play a better role?</div>
</div>
<h1>Homework:</h1>
<h2>Part A:</h2>
Please fully complete Lessons 2 and 3 in the Python course on CodeAcademy.
<ul>
	<li>This includes the "Strings and Console Output", "Date and Time", "Conditionals and Control Flow", and "PygLatin"</li>
</ul>
<strong>Submission: </strong>In order to get credit for this assignment, please send me the link to your CodeAcademy profile in your submission e-mail. This way I can track your progress. This can be done by clicking on “View My Profile” in the upper right hand corner and then just copying and pasting the link in the adress bar. Your link should look like this:
