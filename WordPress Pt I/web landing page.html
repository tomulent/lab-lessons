<strong>Location</strong>: Social Sciences 1 Room 135, Mac Computer Lab, Thursdays 6:00pm-7:45pm

The Internet is becoming more and more instrumental in our lives but it is not as intimidating as you might think. The next quarter is going to focus on breaking down the process of making a website for a potential partner organization. Using code and exploring the backend of the web may feel scary at first, but you’ve got a great support system. Feel free to email or drop by our office hours for all your questions or concerns. We got your back!

<h2 id="late-work-policy"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#late-work-policy" name="user-content-late-work-policy"></a>Late Work Policy</h2>
Late work does not only set you back, but creates extra work for the people grading your assignments. That said, we understand that life happens, so we’ve tried to implement a grading policy that is fair:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Credit for late work will only be given if the student notifies the instructor/lab leader by the time of the deadline that they will be late, along with an explanation why</strong> (which could be extenuating circumstances, or a desire to do a better job while taking a decrease in grade). If no notice is given, no credit will be given for the assignment.</li>
	<li><strong>In the case of just wanting more time to turn it in, there will be a drop of 5% for each 24 hours it is late, up to a week, then no more credit.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>In the case of <em>documented</em> extenuating circumstances</strong> (e.g. sick, with a doctor’s notice, or some other external verification of the extenuating circumstances) the instructor/lab leader will set a new due date, after which the above policy would apply.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="attendance-policy"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#attendance-policy" name="user-content-attendance-policy"></a>Attendance Policy</h2>
Your active participation in Everett labs is crucial not just for your own success, but also for that of your fellow students. Labs move very quickly and there are a limited number of meetings. Consequently, we only allow for two unexcused absences. After that, each unexcused absence will result in a 10% penalty to your final lab grade, which is 25% of your grade in SOCY 30. If you think you cannot make it to lab, please email your lab leader before hand to make arrangements so that you do not fall behind.
<h2 id="classroom-expectations"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#classroom-expectations" name="user-content-classroom-expectations"></a>Classroom Expectations</h2>
Tech labs are an integral part of the Everett Program and should be taken with the same seriousness as any other class. The same goes for interaction with the lab leaders and facilitators. They have been delegated authority by the instructor of record and should be treated with the same respect afforded to any instructor.
<h2 id="academic-integrity"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#academic-integrity" name="user-content-academic-integrity"></a>Academic Integrity</h2>
Cheating on exams and plagiarism are examples of violations in the realm of ethics and integrity. If you have any questions on what constitutes both good scholarship or the consequences of failing to work within campus expectations of honesty and professionalism, please view the available resources through the Division of Undergraduate Education <a href="http://www.ue.ucsc.edu/ai_resources">http://www.ue.ucsc.edu/ai_resources</a>.
