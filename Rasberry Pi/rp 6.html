# Objectives:
In today’s lesson, we will be picking up were we left off last week in our system setup. Last week you downloaded the Raspberry Pi software package, NOOBS, onto your SD cards. Now it is time to actually see the Raspberry PI in action!
<div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">-Students will revisit concepts in hardware by diving deeper into learning how a Hard Disk Drive works.</div>
<div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">-Students will be tested on the python skills they have been building thus far.</div>
<div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">-Students will get a chance to interact with the Raspbian interface and explore the applications and tools available to them.</div>

# Installation Part 2:
<div></div>
**Step 1:** Gather your peripherals and put everything together. The power supply (the white USB cable) should go into the USB port hub.
<div></div>
**Step 2:** Screens should immediately show a window giving you two options to click on. Click on “Raspbian” and hit install. Raspbian is the name of the software created for the Raspberry Pi Foundation and is based off of Linux.
<div></div>
**Step 3:** Let the system boot up! Since this will be the first time we are running our operating systems, it will still take a while to install completely. This should take about 30 minutes. Let your monitors rest to one side and we will come back to them when they are ready.

# In the Meantime...
<div></div>
<div>Let us revisit our concepts in hardware! We are halfway through the quarter now and we should recap the information we learned in the beginning of the quarter to stay on track.</div>
<div></div>
### Understanding Hardware: Revisiting the Idea of the HDD (Hard Disk Drive)
<div>Everyone should now have a general sense of what a hard drive does. But how does it work exactly? Luckily, the great people over at TED-Ed have created a resource for us to use. All of you should follow this <a href="http://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-hard-drives-work-kanawat-senanan#watch">link</a>. We will go through the video as a class, each of you will take the mini quiz under the subheading labeled “Think”, you will read the piece under “Dig Deeper”, and then we will come back together as a class to host the discussion at the end.</div>
<div></div>

# Back to the Raspberry Pi’s:
<div></div>
By now, our computer systems should be ready to go! Everyone should see a bright, welcoming screen complete with the Raspberry Pi logo as the background photo. This means you have successfully run the Raspbian software and are ready to start using the system! Congratulations!
<div></div>
You now have until the end of class to check out the programs and tools that come on this software. Test your python in IDLE, surf the internet, or open any other application you find interesting!

**The GUI is your oyster.**

# Homework:
##  Part A:
You will be preparing a mini "lab write up" for the installation you just ran over the past two classes. The purpose is to reflect on your process and how you went about solving issues. In one page (one-sided, 1.5 spacing) , I would like you to answer the following questions:
<ol>
	<li>What steps did you and your partner take to install the R.P. software and to get the operating system running on your monitor?</li>
	<li>What problems did you run into while running the installation?</li>
	<li>What attempts did you make to troubleshoot the issue?</li>
	<li>What application or tool did you find most interesting that the O.S. has to offer?</li>
	<li>What do YOU want to do with the Raspberry Pi next? ( feel free to think out of the box)</li>
</ol>
**In order to submit, attach your one-pager as a PDF and send to the Raspberry Pi email address. **

## Part B:
Complete the "STUDENT BECOMES THE TEACHER" project in CodeAcademy.

**Email your link to the Raspberry Pi email address. **
