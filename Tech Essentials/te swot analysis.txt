### How do I use SWOT?
A SWOT analysis can be carried out for a product, place, industry or person.

It involves specifying the objective of the business venture or project and identifying the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieve that objective.

They work especially well for identifying inter-organization characteristics. NGOs use SWOT analysis to help achieve goals, both long term and short term!
