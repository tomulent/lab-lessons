We will initiate a discussion of technology: how we interact with technology and the significance of these online networks. Introduce students to issues surrounding technology—access to technology, security, etc—and provide tools on how to select the appropriate program to suit project goals. In addition, students will be introduced to open source and proprietary softwares. In this introduction we will look at how to use the various operations of word processing and spreadsheet editing software programs. Who is ready for a little discussion!
