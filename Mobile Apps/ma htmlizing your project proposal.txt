Make your Project Proposal into an HTML page. That's it.
<h1>Simple, eh?</h1>
Just take your project proposal from 30B and put it into HTML form.
<h2>Parameters</h2>
[list style="orb" color="blue"]
<ul>
	<li>Make each section header (Executive Summary, Methodology, etc.) a &lt;h1&gt;</li>
	<li>Give each heading a descriptive id (like id="goals")</li>
	<li>At the end of each section, include a link that links to the section header
<ul>
	<li>&lt;a href="#goals"&gt;Back To Top&lt;/a&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Wrap each section in a &lt;div&gt;. Don't worry about giving the &lt;div&gt;'s an id. Just put them there</li>
	<li>Make sure everything is correctly marked up. By that we mean no content not inside an HTML tag. If you open a tag, you better close it. A good way to make sure you're doing this is to see if you can collapse your &lt;div&gt;. That's the little triangle or +/- sign on the line number next to your opening &lt;div&gt;. They allow you to make things neater.</li>
	<li>Make an HTML table for the budget</li>
</ul>
