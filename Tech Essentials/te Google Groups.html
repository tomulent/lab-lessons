#### What is it?
Google Groups is an innovative way to interact and collaborate with a set group of individuals through email or forums! It is useful to virtually get together to discuss projects or "meet" with group members. It has been used for just that, but also to keep track of running  a club or group of people about meetings, schedules, and much more. Google Groups makes emailing and talking to others easier, as they are part of your select group that acts as a condensed contact. When really, there are multiple people within the contact! This is important because it will help you stay organized when working with a select group of people. Projects, midterms, finals, and presentation groups are hard enough to manage, so why not place everyone in a virtual group to make it easy?

1. Log into your gmail account; click on the grid; select groups

3. You will need to fill out informational settings for your group. If you create the group, you are the owner. This functions similarly to Google Docs. Change your basic permissions to fit your group's needs.

4. You will need to select the type of group. This is important because the type of group you select determines how your group members will interact with one another.

There are four choices:
<ul>
	<li>Email list: An email list allows users to post from the web or through email. This is a mailing list group.</li>
	<li>Web forum: A web forum allows people to interact with the group and have engaging and interactive discussions on the web. It has web optimized features enabled including moderation tools. Group members post topics and replies through the web interface, but can still receive updates via email.</li>
	<li>Q&amp;A forum: A web forum allows people to interact with the group and have engaging and interactive discussions on the web. It has web optimized features enabled including moderation tools. Group members post topics and replies through the web interface, but can still receive updates via email.</li>
	<li>Collaborative inbox: Topics can be assigned to other members and treated as tasks which can be resolved or reassigned. Additional options are available to control who can assign and receive tasks.</li>
</ul>
